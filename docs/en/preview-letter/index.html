            <p><em>(This article was translated from Vietnamese)</em></p>
<p>There is an anecdote about an occasion at the Tu Dam Temple in Vietnam, when the monks were about to put their sanghati on for the precept recitation ceremony, and Venerable Thien Sieu asked, “Do you know why we say, ‘<em>The Dharma is deep and wonderful</em>’?” Pausing for a few moments, he continued, “because it is here, right in front of you.”</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-minh-hyT-Minh-Hy-1-edited" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-minh-hy/UdrK3qLuZz-2000.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>I heard this anecdote when the Venerable Abbot of Bao Lam Temple recounted it to us at Dieu Tram Nunnery. This question has stayed with me ever since - How can the wonderful and deep Dharma be right in front of us? Why can’t I see it? Is it because there are many things around that are so ordinary that I am unable to see it?</p>
<p>At parties, we often offer special dishes. If there is only rice and green vegetables, we cannot call it  We eat them every day, every week, every month, the whole year round, we eat them our whole life through. There are people who cannot bear it if they don’t have rice, even for one or two days. But if that is so, then rice and green vegetables are not ordinary. They are special because everyone can eat them and cannot live without these staples. “Special dishes” at parties are special, but we only eat them occasionally. We cannot eat them every day like we eat rice. <em>No one loves us like rice does.</em></p>
<p>The teachings of the Buddha are the same. There are Dharma doors that we practice every day so we find them very ordinary. In fact, they are very special because irrespective of place or situation, they can be easily practiced by everyone.</p>
<p>When learning and practicing profound meditations such as impermanence, non-self, emptiness, signlessness, aimlessness, or interbeing, we need to be able to maintain them with solidity and freedom during daily life. Our steps and mindful breathing have the capacity to reflect and also to nourish the powerful energy source of these meditations.</p>
<p>We need to develop this way of looking. Each step, each breath, each time we relax is not an ordinary practice but a very special one, as it is able to carry within itself the profound insights of meditation.</p>
<p>Perhaps rice and boiled vegetables have become ordinary due to the way we eat them, especially if we haven’t yet been able to appreciate that “a grain of rice is a jadestone from heaven”. If you allow yourself to look into a bowl of rice in your hand with appreciation, then gratitude and happiness will be born in your heart right in that moment. Happiness will come very quickly, with just one breath. You will smile and know that you are very fortunate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Beings all over the Earth<br/>
are struggling to live.<br/>
I aspire to practice deeply<br/>
so all may have enough to eat.”<br/>
Gatha “Before Eating” - Thich Nhat Hanh, <em>Stepping into Freedom</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this way, there are things that are very familiar, but they never become out of date. Each step, each in and out breath, each bowl of rice can become a party if our heart is filled with gratitude.</p>
<p>One time, Thay’s attendant noticed that Thay was a little different. After giving a Dharma talk Thay came back to his hut, drank a cup of tea, took his straw hat and went directly for walking meditation. Usually he would rest a little longer. Upon arriving at the gathering place, Thay bowed to the sangha and led the walk. Everything unfolded without delay. With light and free steps, Thay led the sangha to the Sixteen Buddhas, his favorite place, where he liked to stop and rest during walking meditation. As soon as the sangha sat down, the church bells rang. The attendant looked at Thay who had a very bright smile on his face. It turned out that there was a delegation of monks from another country visiting Plum Village. That was the very first time they had came to Upper Hamlet and joined the practice of walking meditation. Therefore, Thay wanted to offer them a miraculous moment. Thay was very pleased with that moment, as everything happened just at the right time. It is not only with good tea or delicious food that we can treat our guests.</p>
<p>A beautiful moment can help the happiness in people’s hearts grow bigger. Such a moment is a party that we can offer our beloved ones many times a day. But first of all, we need to have the ability to perceive, to feel, and to offer ourselves such parties. If we do not know how to drink tea, how can we offer our friends a good cup of tea? It is very difficult for a busy person to treat others to a relaxing and free moment.</p>
<p>Have you treated yourself today with any happy moments?</p>

            <div class="author">Brother Chân Nguyên Tịnh</div>
            <p><em><strong>Brother Nguyên Tịnh</strong> was ordained in the year 2000 in Vietnam. In 2014, he decided to join the Plum Village sangha in Upper Hamlet. He is one of our Senior Dharma Teachers and is much loved for his gentle, humble bearing and for his love of poetry. In recent years he has spent much of his time as an attendant to Thay.</em></p>
<p><em>(Excerpts from a Practice Journal)</em></p>
<h2><em>03 November, 2015:</em><br/> Let Me Also Be Present</h2>
<p>Today is a Monastic Day. I went quite early to the Hermitage so I could walk on the grounds. A few brown robes were already there, each enjoying the serenity. Thầy was away for health treatment in the U.S. and had yet to return. Three more days and it would be a full year since I first arrived in Plum Village.</p>
<p>The sun was rising. I sat by a tree next to <em>Phương Khê</em> - the “fragrant creek”. It was  the rainy season so the creek was in full flow, and sitting there, I could listen to its murmur. I closed my eyes and followed my breathing. The morning sun embraced me.</p>
<p>In recent days my mind has been filled with desolation, as if I had just set foot on a cold, deserted island, so that I could face myself alone and find the answers for my life. Somewhere in me was a flicker of guilt as I seemed indifferent to all I had. Did I really need to choose my own path and leave behind all the hope and trust that so many had bestowed on me and had wished for me to fulfill? Images of Kim Sơn Temple, where I ordained and studied for 14 years, kept coming back like howling waves tormenting my five skandhas. Phrases I had heard before and thought had nothing to do with me were now arising: Have I left behind my teacher and ancestral teachers? Did I turn my back on my roots? Have I taken for granted the relationships in my life before this? Should I go back to my old life?</p>
<p>In those days, during sitting meditation, these thoughts continued to emerge, rocking me and confining me in an invisible room. I called on Thầy, placing my attention on his solid, peaceful, and courageous energy that was protecting me.</p>
<p>In that same moment the image of a carp leaping the dragon gate, majestic yet unmistakably lonely, suddenly appeared in my mind. The carp leaps with all its might in order to transform into a dragon. That leap can give it a sense of loss as it leaves behind the lake, the rocks, the moss, and all the things that are familiar to the life of a carp. This loss is also a turning point. If it can leap to the other side and become a dragon, the carp of old would see that it has really lost nothing. Although there is no longer the need for moss or rock holes to make a home or for old familiar things, the carp of old does not look down on them. It still occasionally visits the old places and finds them even more beautiful, seen through the eyes of a dragon.</p>
<p>That moment passed as fast as lightning. I held fast to the breath and nourished the image deeply in my mind. I saw that I could bring along both my land ancestors and spiritual ancestors from Kim Son Temple. The answer came without a doubt: I am not letting others down, I am not betraying them, I am not running away; I am just doing what I need to do. I do so for myself, for the aspiration to strengthen my old relationships with the Buddhist Association, with my teacher and the ancestral teachers, and with the temple that gave me spiritual birth. If I do it well, then my return will be beautiful. That's when I realized that I no longer felt smothered by the old customs that had once confined me, and overpowered me. I am establishing sovereignty over my spiritual path, unlimited by existing conventions. I know what I lack and I am on my way to making a beautiful foundation that I truly lack and hunger for.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes. Tears streamed down my cheeks. The sun was already high. I smiled, my heart filled with gratitude. In the heart of the fragrant creek, I saw myself more clearly. I was so delighted to find that I had touched an inner freedom and no longer clung to the usual material and emotional comforts. I did not look down upon them, nor feel averse towards them. It is just that I found I no longer fit that way of life. I joined my palms, bowed, and got up to walk to the old cedars. Encountering my elder Brother Phap Ung, I smiled, bowed to him, and felt deeply grateful for the energy of the sangha.</p>
<p>All afternoon, I sat in meditation in a corner of the old wooden barn to deepen that insight. By the time I stepped outside, the sangha had just finished playing games and were exchanging gifts. If I had not had the opportunity to sit, walk, work, drink tea, or eat, right in the midst of the sangha every day for the past year, I know it would have been very difficult to encounter a miraculous moment like this.</p>
<h2>The Day of Return</h2>
<p>During my time at Kim Son Temple, I enjoyed walking in front and paying respect to the stupa of Brother Tri Thuyen, a young monk who was shot by the French in 1947. I knew Thay and Br. Tri Thuyen were close friends, having heard Thay speak of their friendship in his books and talks.</p>
<p>On the 10<sup>th</sup> of March, 2016, I received the surprising news that I would soon have an opportunity to be Thay's attendant. Having the great fortune to be near Thay, I learned from the lessons he transmitted. At each meal, Thay brought each spoonful of food to his mouth with utter attention, care, and enjoyment. Mindfulness had become his life. Thay enjoyed each sip of tea with tranquility. Observing and enjoying nature, Thay had become a free person (with nothing to do, and nowhere to go). One bud of white champaca blooms and for Thay, it is a miracle. I loved so much every time I saw Thay taking his left hand to care for and wake up his right hand. Thay sat at his desk and with his left hand held a calligraphy brush to draw circle after circle, smiling. A flower bloomed on the page, it bloomed in Thay's heart, in the hearts of each of us.</p>
<h2><em>25 March, 2016:</em><br/>16<sup>th</sup> Day Attending Thay</h2>
<p>Like the ancestral teachers of the past, Thay is also transmitting the living Dharma day and night: you support my feet, for you I walk; you offer medicine, for you I drink it; you bring me rice, for you I eat it; you are disrespectful, I reprimand for your sake; you make me tea, for you I reach out to receive it; you want to learn, for you I teach; you bring me the potty, for you I urinate; you want to learn impermanence, for you I am ill. Try asking me if I have transmitted the <em>Mind Seal</em> to you. Has anyone let anyone down?</p>
<p>I could feel this during my time as an attendant. Thay is also ill for the sangha, for Plum Village, so that his monastic children have a chance to grow. Thay bears bodily pain each day, and he has the time to watch life springing up. If that is not a miracle, if that is not a living teaching, then what is? If we are not able to receive these concrete lessons from Thay, how can we continue to ask for more? Thay’s strength is still emanating from his eyes.</p>
<p>I remember the second morning of the “Gratitude” Great Precepts Transmission Ceremony, Thay was staying at the Sitting Still Hut and woke early to drink tea. Thay indicated to us, his two attendants, to put on our long robes and push Thay in his wheelchair to view the moon. I pushed the wheelchair along a path near the Upper Hamlet bell tower. The morning moon was full and bright. Thay sat still, enjoying the moon, and often raised his hand to show us the way to be in deeper contact with the moon. Entering the Still Water Meditation Hall, Thay looked around a little at the decorations, then continued to view the moon and to show it to us. After that, Thay agreed to visit the Transformation Hall.</p>
<p>The venerable monks were at breakfast and Thay joined them. Thay ate very mindfully, carefully and decisively bringing each spoonful of food to his mouth. His eyes were as bright as the eyes I had met in Thailand in 2013. Thay’s eyes and bearing led Venerable Giac Quang to tears. After breakfast Thay returned to the Sitting Still Hut. The sun was just appearing. Thay saw it and pointed it out to everyone, then invited the venerables to watch the sun rise in his hut. The scene was glorious.</p>
<h2><em>5 April, 2016:</em><br/>27<sup>th</sup> Day Attending Thay</h2>
<p>Asleep in the heart of the Hermitage, I dreamt of a young boy of 10 who was poor and sick. The boy knew he had to take a special train to go somewhere and then he would find the life he is meant to live. He had to go, but he did not have any money. Carrying a bag containing a few items, he chose his moment to hide in a dark, cramped cargo hold. The train started and meandered through the plains, hills, and wild, ancient forests.</p>
<p>The train passed through a dark tunnel and suddenly the boy heard words in his mind like torrential rain pouring down. Suddenly he felt so sad. In the rear vision mirror, he saw that he was truly a lone walker with no friends, no family, without a word of solace or sympathy from anyone. Prior to this for some unknown reason, all his friends had scattered in different directions. Perhaps some were also alone on an express train headed for another destination, surely just as lonely. The boy was sad, but he did not cry.</p>
<p>The majesty of the sky, the forest, and the trees called the boy back to their beauty. He could not sit still in the dark. A voice from the depths of his heart was calling out to him, moving him. He looked out of the door, and even put his head outside to see the view as the train passed through forests and valleys. He completely forgot that he might be discovered, and was happy just looking.</p>
<p>The train slowed down without stopping and the wind no longer whistled. The train driver's side window opened and the boy could clearly see the gentle and cheerful face of the driver. Through the rear vision mirror, the driver's eyes turned in the direction of the boy. He was paralyzed with fear that he would be found and kicked off the train! But in that moment, the driver smiled an all too familiar smile which echoed in the boy's subconscious. The boy knew that he was safe and that he would arrive where he needed to go. The driver even winked and nodded at the boy and he suddenly said a sentence, or a line from a poem: “We always love and care for the urchins like you”.</p>
<p>I woke up with tears in my eyes, and cried deeply and like a child. The tears were like drops of water from the fragrant well at Kim Son Temple, once drunk by a young novice monk. Thay’s image had replaced that of the train driver. My heart called out, “O Thay, my dear teacher.”</p>
<p>Something about the dream shook my five skandhas fiercely. I felt like the poor, ragged child who was searching for the most precious thing in his life, and I had been allowed to board the train home. The one driving the train had accepted me with a noble and virtuous smile. I was no longer a stranger, no longer the one who carried so much guilt on the journey home. For a thousand lifetimes, I have been that poor, sick child. For a thousand lifetimes, Thay has been that driver, bringing me back to a safe and peaceful place where I could find all that I have ever sought, so that I could truly be me. A dream is not just a dream. For me, the dream contained my entire heritage and path.</p>
<h2>The Call to Enter the Stream</h2>
<p>One afternoon I was walking from Son Ha to the Upper Hamlet. The horizon was ablaze with the changing colours and falling leaves of the forest, and golden leaves carpeted the path. I saw a small tuft of grass and some new leaves that I had not noticed before though I have trodden this path countless times. Suddenly, I understood why Thay taught us again and again about breathing and walking, about the beauty of the legendary path, or sang praises of the purple bamboo and the blue sky, or showed us the miracle of a single leaf.</p>
<p>When I used to listen to his Dharma talks or read his books or hear stories about Thay from my brothers, I often wondered - <em>What is it about those things that Thay never tires of reminding his disciples to notice?</em> That day, seeing the grass and new leaves on a well-trodden path, I smiled. I realized that I had found in my own eyes the beauty and mystery of these seemingly ordinary things. Having seen it once, I can offer myself once again that way of looking. These simple discoveries have nurtured my joy of practicing, nurtured my gratitude for Thay's insights, which have been adapted to the times, and nurtured my faith in the sangha's ability to receive and transmit the ceaseless flow of the spiritual river.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Con đường lá<br/>
Trải ngàn thu<br/>
Cánh mai nở<br/>
Thoảng hương trầm<br/>
Thơm mỗi nét cổ thư.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A thousand autumns pave<br/>
the leaf strewn path.<br/>
One plum branch blossoms,<br/>
the fragrance of sandalwood incense<br/>
infuses each ancient brush stroke.</p>

            <div class="author">Brother Chân Pháp Dung</div>
            <!-- Jan.27th, 2021 -->
<p>Dear Friends on the path, I hope you enjoy this digital painting that was inspired by Thay’s account of his dream where he was a music student who had to perform in front of a university audience. I began envisioning it one morning after waking up from my own dream in which Thay invited a bell to help us all come back to the present moment. As he invited the bell, his hands moved around it in a cinematographic way with multiple hands merging in and out of each other, with some hands holding various musical instruments.</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-phap-dungthay-bell3-torn-edges" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-phap-dung/ORsya3a2Hg-2000.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>In the days I was drawing this, the violent riot at the US Capitol occurred (January 2021). America once more saw the ugly side of itself again. I felt sad for the people who were tasked to help lead and unite the divided people of this nation. So this artistic exploration became a healing activity for me, a kind of balm for my heart from the mental ache that I was feeling for our human family. Focusing on Thay’s life and all the suffering and division that he managed to overcome, I felt more determined than ever to help realize his dream of building mindful communities where people from all walks of life can live harmoniously together even with differences of opinion, values, and approaches.</p>
<p>I kept this image from my dream and the resounding of the bell in my heart throughout the day, stopping periodically while walking, eating, or sitting to breathe and remember what is most important. I prayed for the people of this land, from the urban coasts to the rugged mountains and across the rural central valleys. I projected the energy of this serene bell to everyone who may be feeling left out for whatever reason or cause, that their hearts could be calm, their minds find some space, and their spirits feel some relief from all the hate, blame, and wrong perceptions of separation.</p>
<p>Many years ago in a Dharma Talk, Thay shared about this dream where he was a student in a prestigious music school. It was time for the finals and everyone had to perform with their instruments in front of an audience. Thay was a little nervous in the dream because he had never learned how to play any musical instruments, so he did not know how he would pass this final test.</p>
<p>When it was time, Thay stood at the podium with his hands in his pocket. He stared into the audience, calmly following his breathing; suddenly he felt in his pocket the cold metallic surface of the mini bell that he normally brings with him wherever he goes. He had been taught to use this bell at the temple and realized in that moment that this bell was also a musical instrument. Thay took out the bell, raised it to the audience and invited a sound as he had done his whole life. The sound of the bell resonating throughout the auditorium brought peace and serenity to everyone who heard it.</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-phap-dungbai-T-Phap-Dung-4" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-phap-dung/DcPRVqBRiq-1400.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>As the moment ended in the dream, Thay shared that he turned to the side of the stage to look for his teacher. Thay felt excited in the dream that he would be able to see his teacher, but as his teacher was about to enter into view, Thay woke up. Even so, in his heart he somehow knew who his teacher must have been. Throughout the years, I have heard Thay share this story a few times, always leaving the ending open as an invitation for us to all imagine and discover for ourselves who the “teacher” must have been. It is my favorite part of his account because it allows us to participate and finish the story ourselves. Maybe that is why I have internalized the story and it has manifested in my dream.</p>
<p>I finished this drawing on MLK (Martin Luther King) Day, at the end of our lazy day on January 18<sup>th</sup>, and so I dedicated it to the spiritual friendship between Thay and Dr. King and their mutual vision of building a global “beloved community” where we see each other as siblings of one family.  I penned at the bottom of the drawing a few lines that I adapted from the bell gatha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>May the sound of this bell bring relief to the world.
May the hearers awake from their delusion of a separate self.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I write in this moment, I think of Thay’s legacy of renewing Buddhist practices and all the effort he put into introducing to the world the meaning and practice of inviting and listening to the sound of the bell. I cannot imagine how many Dharma Talks our teacher must have given on this topic. The simple act of stopping everything that we are doing when we hear the bell being invited, including our thinking and conversations, and returning all our attention to our conscious breathing was invented or adapted by our teacher. Before that in the temples, the bell did not have this explicit function or significance. Thay formulated this practice as the medicine for our times, an antidote to our modern culture of running and grasping and to our incapacity to be fully present to what is happening in the present moment, caught in our constant over thinking.</p>
<p>Thay has even expanded this practice of listening to the bell and applied it to include the sound of the clock chiming. In almost every Plum Village practice center, you will find a chiming clock installed in the dining hall that resounds every fifteen or thirty minutes. Practitioners are asked to stop all their activities when they hear the chime and to come back and pay attention to their breathing for a few in and out breaths. We are taught to close our eyes and to silently recite this gatha: <em>“Listen, listen, this wonderful sound brings me back to my true home”</em>, and recognize the present moment and the wonder of simply being alive.</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-phap-dungT-Phap-Dung-4edited" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-phap-dung/NSGV7-d5ir-2000.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>At this moment, I invite everyone to continue Thay’s legacy by maintaining this practice of listening to the sound of the bell in your own home, workplace, or wherever you may be. You may like to install a chiming clock in your living room or kitchen to remind you to stop. You may install a digital mindfulness bell on your laptop or smartphone and program it to sound periodically to help us stop during our busy day. When you stop, close your eyes, recite the gatha, and come back to your “true home”, envisioning all of us breathing together throughout this land and around this planet, creating a collective energy of peace and kindness, and connecting us all in a moment of interbeing. This is not a practice of magic or some romanticized imagination; it has a real potential to bring immediate benefit to ourselves, to those near, and to everyone that may randomly cross our mental field and may not even be in our awareness. No energy is ever lost. No ripples in the pond are without some effect, some contribution. No mental intention of kindness and acceptance will be lost. I invite everyone to help us maintain this collective field of good-will as opposed to ill-will, of heart force instead of aggression, no matter what or who confronts us, and together we can support one another on our path to build the beloved community, bring change, and contribute to our collective awakening.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Brother Pháp Dung</p>

            <div class="author">Brother Chân Pháp Hải</div>
            <p><em>Brother Chân Pháp Hải is an elder in the Plum Village tradition. In this interview excerpt from the budding Mountain Spring Monastery near Sydney, he shares with his younger monastic siblings his experiences, challenges, growing insights and lifesavers through 25 years of living in the Dharma and the sangha.</em></p>
<h2>The Spirit of Experimentation in the Early Days of Plum Village</h2>
<p>When I first arrived in 1996 I was touched by the joy and enthusiasm that everybody had, even with the very simple conditions at the time. For example, when travelling from Upper Hamlet to New Hamlet, we did not have enough transport, so many of us would sit on the floor in the back of the shopping van, on blankets.</p>
<p>When I ordained as a novice, the community was small – around 15 brothers – and the majority of us were of a similar age, so we had a lot of energy. I remember when we planted the trees and dug out the lotus pond in the middle of Upper Hamlet, Br. Pháp Ứng and Br. Pháp Hiền (Michael C.) ran jumping into the pond in their short robes, playing in the mud. There were many simple joys like that. Many trees that now provide shade around Upper Hamlet were planted as small saplings by the brothers on their ordination anniversaries. Going through everything together in such a small sangha fostered a sense of closeness.</p>
<p>We did not yet have a designated monks’ building. The current one was built in 2002. We used to live in the <em>Stone</em> and <em>Bamboo buildings</em>, the <em>Turtle Lodge</em> and <em>Dharma Breeze</em>, as well as in rooms behind the kitchen. During large retreats like the Summer Retreat, the brothers would move out to tents, or consolidate in a few rooms, and some of our sisters as well as the guests would move into our rooms.</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-phap-haiscan00012" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-phap-hai/LVRKSGoIbM-870.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>Being a small and young sangha, there was a lot less organisation, which gave room for a certain amount of experimentation to try different practices. For example, the practice of Shining Light did not exist in its current form for the first few years that I was in Plum Village. Before we began this practice, in the ceremony to close the winter retreat we would make a formal request, “If you have seen, heard or suspected something about my practice, please share with us.” Then the elder, usually Thầy Giac Thanh, replied, “You’ve all practiced well, but you could do better next year. Please touch the earth three times.” After a couple of years Thầy began to give teachings about how we should renew this practice and not just do it as a form. The first few Shining Light sessions we had were a little intense, because we had not yet understood deeply how to engage with this practice. Of course, we are still learning, even after twenty years. At the time, we also didn’t need to be present, in which case we just received a letter. We quickly discovered that the Shining Light practice was more effective and strengthening for the person and for the Sangha as a whole, if we were present.</p>
<p>Other practices have disappeared, like fast walking meditation. One time, Thầy said to us, “If you don’t sweat once a day, you are not my disciple.” Thầy wanted to encourage everyone to exercise and to jog once a day. After one of our trips to China, Thầy proposed that the Sangha incorporate fast walking meditation into our practice schedule. So Thầy Pháp Niệm and Thầy Pháp Độ bulldozed a path around the Linden Tree in Upper Hamlet, put down some white gravel, and Thầy suggested that we would do fast walking Chinese style before sitting meditation in the morning. We began this practice in the winter. As everyone knows, the winter in France is usually wet and cold. So often the back of our robes would be wet and white with the flecks of mud from the wet gravel.</p>
<p>At one point, Thầy suggested for every hamlet to have a scale at the end of the table to weigh our food. We would serve our food, weigh our bowl, and take note of how much we took. One time Thầy noticed I was not doing it and Thầy said to me, “Brother Pháp Hải, you need to be like a river, not like a drop of water.” I replied, “Thầy, a kilo of potatoes is very different from a kilo of lettuce.” Thầy replied, “You think too much, Brother Pháp Hải.”</p>
<h2>Not feeling ready is a gift</h2>
<p>We did not have all the classes and the structure that we have today. We learned mostly by observing and doing. Classes are wonderful, important and needed. At the same time the greatest learning we can ever have is in our everyday life. We do not discover the heart of the Dharma through books or classes. Those are about the Dharma, but they are not the Dharma. This is the difference between Dharma as lists, techniques and concepts and Dharma as a lived reality.</p>
<p>When I was a novice, we were lucky enough to have a Fine Manner’s class with Thầy Giác Thanh, who offered what I think is the most important advice that I ever got in my monastic life, “What I want to share with you most of all is - don’t cover over your monastic life with a whole lot of bells and incense.” What a beautiful encouragement for us not to hide behind anything, but to bring ourselves fully to our practice and to offer what we have, even if we think it is not much: I myself certainly do not have much to offer.</p>

<p>Today I hear some of the young ones say, “I’m not ready.” Honestly, after 25 years, I really still do not feel ready. Even now, giving a Dharma talk, I always feel like I have nothing much of value to share. Maybe if I felt ready, there would be a problem. Not feeling ready is a gift. We just show up in the best way we can and offer what we have. Nobody ever gave me classes on how to give a Dharma talk. I just learned by doing.</p>
<p>Thầy also had different emphases from time to time. At one time he would ask us to give spontaneous teachings. In the middle of walking meditation or another activity, he might ask, “Sr. Kính Nghiêm, offer us a sutra,” and the person would then need to share an invitation to practice from a place of aliveness and spontaneity. There was no time to prepare, we just had to do it. It was nerve-wracking, but also a lot of fun.</p>
<h2>Strong Medicine from Thầy</h2>
<p>When I was a young monk, I suffered a lot. At one time, I shared with Thầy a very deep pain that I was carrying. Thầy drank his tea, looked out the window and then he coughed. As he was coughing, I thought, “Uh oh.” (When he used to cough like that, we knew that we were going to get the hammer.) Thầy put down his cup, turned to me and said, “Sư chú Pháp Hải, why did you come to Thầy and ask questions that you already know the answers to? Go and do it!” That is all the teaching I got! And so I stood up, bowed, and walked out. I had hoped Thầy would say something like “There there, poor you.” etc., therefore I felt a bit angry with Thầy. As I came out of Thay’s room, as a 22 year old, I remember kicking the gravel around the driveway in New Hamlet. For about two Dharma Talks whenever Thầy caught my eye, he would smile lightly. I am ashamed to tell you that it actually took me a couple of weeks to realise what Thầy had offered me. Thầy would always point to the capacity in you and water your confidence in your own ability to transform. The reality was, I did know exactly what I needed to do. I just didn’t want to do it. Thầy knew this and offered what I needed most in that moment and in my life of practice: confidence in my capacity to be able to understand and resolve it myself. Even as I know well that my capacity is small and as shown in the story above, my roots are shallow. That was the strongest and most precious teaching I ever received from my teacher and I am deeply grateful. That was when Thầy really became my teacher, not just a far away figure that I would listen to at a Dharma Talk or attend, without any real relationship.</p>
<p>Whilst others can help and support us, ultimately, as practitioners, we ourselves need to be able to look deeply and understand our situation to be able to really transform our suffering. Thầy gave us those tools.</p>

<h2>My biggest challenges in the early days</h2>
<p>One of the challenges I faced growing up in the Sangha was learning how to ask for and receive support. I came from a family environment in which I had to be very responsible in order to survive, so I had a tendency to be a bit too responsible and not want to communicate what was really going on inside. I also did not know how to take advantage of the presence of my elder brothers or sisters. The sangha’s Shining Light and guidance helped me to realise that my real contribution and real transformation was not in volunteering for many things, but something else entirely. I had to learn to be one element of the Sangha rather than taking over, even if I thought I was helping. This is a bit like the difference between being a soloist and playing in a band. Of course, this is a lifetime’s journey and I still have a lot to learn in this area.</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-phap-hai12065878101536898390142693147459611197513014n-2cut" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-phap-hai/N0b9GxyKE_-528.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>Another challenge was our distinctly direct Australian communication style. We show respect and closeness to those we care about by being very direct, and have a self- and other-deprecating sense of humour. This comes from the background of the difficult environment of Australia - droughts, floods, fires - needing to make light of it and to come together as a collective. For example, last year a flood washed out both roads into and out of this mountain, leaving us cut off from supplies for 10 days. The local people began joking around, downplaying it, “Oh, it’s a bit bloody wet, hey mate?! (laughter)”. I had that tendency coming to Plum Village. If somebody was too serious or emotional about something, I would respond in this way. For many other cultures, this feels rude, which meant I had a lot of Beginning Anews. I needed to learn and adapt. Between us, coming back to Australia I had to go through reverse culture shock.</p>
<h2>Lifesavers</h2>
<p>The biggest lifesaver of my monastic life is something that many do not enjoy at all, and that is my Shining Light letters. A few years ago I went through a situation where my whole world fell apart and for a brief moment I felt that the world or the sangha would be a better place without me in it. It was very difficult to see any good qualities in myself. I think we all have these moments. In that challenging moment, I reached for my Shining Light letters. I have accumulated a lot over the past quarter of a century. I read each of them and saw how clearly the sangha as a whole saw me. Not only did the sangha accept me, but actually loved me for who I am. In reading those letters, I felt as if the sangha was saying to me, “We see you, we see the Dharma you are meant to bring, and you are important to us.” Being seen and feeling this deep connection is something very precious. It honestly saved my life. I recommend that you do it.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago I had a dream in which Thầy came up behind me, put his two hands on my shoulders and said, “Sư em Pháp Hải, is it <em>Yes</em> or is it <em>No</em>?” In the dream I turned to Thầy and said, “It is <em>Yes</em>, Thầy.” That dream has always remained with me. Whenever I go through a difficult moment, this is the other lifesaver I have: the practice to say “Yes” to whatever the situation is and have the mindset of “I am here and available. I will do what I can.”</p>

<h2>Tapping into the Insight of Thầy</h2>
<p>A few years ago in a monastic retreat in Magnolia Grove a couple of us were having tea together. In that conversation, we were discussing, “What do you feel Thầy asked you to do or what was the invitation that Thầy offered to you?” It was a very beautiful conversation. Reflecting on it I felt that Thầy transmitted something unique to each of us. When we come together, there is a beautiful flowering. What Thầy shared with me was “If you’re doing the same thing in 20 years, you will have failed.” I hold that. Of course, Thầy was not talking about the outer forms of the practice but how I, for example, relate to practices such as mindfulness of breathing or to my brothers and sisters. It was an invitation to go a little bit more deeply and to not be afraid of unpacking the riches that Thầy has already offered us.</p>
<p>Over the years when our community offers teachings, I have witnessed people being blown away by teachings that often seem quite ordinary to us but are rarely taught in other lineages. Thầy is an extraordinary teacher and has offered us so much, in an incredibly condensed form, in the talks on Thursdays and Sundays and through his way of life. For example, while I was giving a weekend retreat on the Four Nutriments, a very well-known Theravadin sutra scholar and teacher approached me saying: “Did Thich Nhat Hanh teach this in Plum Village? We only teach this in the context of quite focused meditation retreats for advanced practitioners.” In Plum Village of course, we consider it one of the most essential teachings of the Buddha and Thầy offered us many teachings on the Four Nutriments. I really feel that our job as practitioners and Dharma Teachers is to unpack these riches, to keep exploring and developing them and offering them to the world.</p>
<h2>The Role of Elders</h2>
<p>I ordained when I was 21 years old and this year I turned 46. There are young monastics that were born after I was already a monk. Wow! Our community, from being a young community in physical and Dharma age is beginning to consider what it means to be an elder. I like to ask myself, “What does it mean to be a resource, to take care, to hold space and not dominate, to not get caught up in so much administration but to really try to listen and care for the young ones?” I think of our role as an elder much like being the banks of the river, helping to support the flow of the river and trying not to block it. While we support the flow of the river, we are also being shaped by it.</p>
<p>What I really want to share with you is that even though we may have different ways of showing it, all your elders care deeply for the young ones and want to offer you the best conditions we can.</p>
<h2>Developing Spiritual Friendships</h2>
<p>A while back I had the chance to mentor aspirants and young novices at Deer Park. They asked me for some advice on how to connect with the elders since sometimes they felt a bit distant. If we see the sangha as a garden, like Thầy shared in <em>Joyfully Together</em>, then as a young monastic the most wonderful thing we can do is walk under the shade of these tall trees who are our elders and rest against their trunk. Soon enough, you will also have younger brothers (and sisters) to whom you will be offering support and care and guidance.</p>
<p>Good friendship in Buddhism means more than just associating with people that share our interests or have similar outlooks. It means actively seeking out companions to whom we can look for guidance and instruction.</p>
<p>A good mentor or elder from time to time will hopefully share things that we disagree with or we see differently, and in those moments we should know that we have indeed met a good and kind friend, since they will help us to grow in some way.</p>
<p>Our relationship with each other as elders and juniors is very much a reciprocal one. I encourage each of you to actively build your spiritual friendship with your elders, taking every opportunity to naturally approach them, drink tea and connect with them, especially if they are different from you. You will then discover many amazing things about them. They will offer you many deep gifts. Most of all, if you build a Dharma friendship with them, you will discover that they are human. That will give you confidence in your Dharma because you will see the unique nature of the Dharma Body and Dharma expression of each one - and then, most importantly, you will begin to see it in yourself.</p>
<p>So please, do not underestimate the importance of this relationship between elders and juniors. Do not take this special gift for granted. It is one of the most precious transmissions of monastic culture. If we cultivate it properly by allowing ourselves to be challenged and supported by the sangha, listened to and sometimes challenged; welcoming confusion and doubt, joy, vulnerability, confidence, and guidance, then we will generate within ourselves all of the tools we need in order to go very far on the path.</p>
<p>If you find yourself too busy in work or planning for retreats, those are the times that you should find time to hang out with your mentor or elders. Please make time in your day and space in your mind to do so.</p>
<p>May these simple words from the heart of your elder brother be of use for you on your path both now and for a long time in the future. Please treasure every moment of the Sangha just as it is right now. In a few years you will look back with much fondness on this time and understand it for the gift that it is.</p>

<p>Do you remember the moment you went from being aware that nature was being damaged and destroyed, to deciding that you would take action to stop the destruction?</p>
<p>One of the most sacred places for me as a child was a certain forest in the hills, near where we lived, in the North of England. In the Autumn, we would go there as a family to pick mushrooms, and these are some of my happiest childhood memories. It was a wild and beautiful wood in a deep, twisting valley, carved by a loud, rushing torrent. Some of the best places to find mushrooms were mossy banks so steep you had to hang on to the grass with your hands not to go tumbling down the ravine. We never saw anyone else in that wood - it felt like it was our very own special place. We would come home with baskets overflowing with delicious mushrooms - chanterelles, horns of plenty, hedgehog mushrooms, and of course, the majestic cèpes! I vividly remember the pure and simple joy of discovering hidden patches of mushrooms under the fallen leaves, nestled down deep in the thick moss.</p>
<p>One year we went back there and half the wood was gone. On one side of the valley, every single tree had been chopped down and dragged away. What was left looked like a battlefield. Even the side that had not been cut felt damaged, as if the trees were in mourning. Where the forest had been felled, the earth was torn - scarred with the tracks of giant machines. The whole forest felt diminished, broken and vulnerable. I felt so angry and confused. Why would anyone do this? Why would anyone destroy this magical cathedral of green and leave behind a wasteland?</p>
<p>Looking back, I think this was one of those pivotal moments where I went from being <em>aware</em> that nature was being damaged and destroyed, to making the determination to <em>take action</em> and stop the destruction. I was determined to try to find a way for us to live without cutting off the very branch we are sitting on. The first time I heard the term “global warming,” I was around 12 years old, and since then, my whole life has been lived with an awareness of the rapidly accelerating pace of desecration of our earth. For years I struggled to see how I could make a difference in the face of such a gigantic threat, and I was convinced that we were in fact doomed as a civilisation. It was only when I met Thay and the sangha that I started to see a path forward.</p>
<p>We know that our climate is now rapidly changing and we may already have irreversibly disrupted the delicate balance of conditions that allowed us to flourish as a species over the last 12,000 years. We are already seeing the effects of climate stress in many parts of the world, which make life more difficult, especially for those on the edge of poverty. This is happening now.</p>
<p>This is in large part why I became a monk. I could see that for humanity, the years of being able to take and take from Mother Earth would soon be coming to an end. The only question for me was how to act <em>now</em>, knowing what was to come.</p>
<p>As I spent more time with the monks and nuns in Plum Village, and listening to Thay's teaching, I started to imagine what the world would be like if there were more people in it who were trained like them; people trained in <em><strong>the art of peace</strong></em> - who would not take sides in a conflict, who would share their last morsel of food, who would bring the balm of love and forgiveness to a situation of anger and fear, and who would know how to help people heal from the scars of trauma in its many forms. Perhaps more than all of that, I started to see the power of a group of people trained in <em><strong>the art of living as a community</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Thay has always been very clear that it is the <em>applied</em> insight of interbeing, that can help our civilisation to change from its current course of destruction. We know that it is the prajnaparamita insight of emptiness that can cut through the bonds of our suffering—the suffering that binds us to a way of life driven by competition and selfishness. But sometimes that insight seems far away, abstract or impractical—I used to think of it as something that could only be realised after many decades of practice, or even something that I could not attain in this life. But now, and especially after going to Glasgow, I see that we are already <em>living</em> this insight, which is built into the very fabric of our life as a community. It is this <em>applied</em> insight that we can offer to the world.</p>
<p>In October, Brother Phap Huu, Sister Lang Nghiem, Sister Hien Nghiem and I attended the TED Countdown event in Edinburgh. It was an event designed to inspire and prepare people for the COP26 UN climate summit in Glasgow, which would take place a couple of weeks later. When we returned to Plum Village, we were all focussed on rejoining the annual Rains Retreat. But so many people had been touched by the presence of the monastics in Edinburgh, especially by Sister Hien Nghiem’s TED talk<span class='note'>©Photo: Ryan Lash, TED Cooldown Summit, Oct 15, 2021</span>, that they then wanted to invite us to Glasgow as well. We quickly re-assessed the situation and found a way for two of us to represent the sangha at this historic event.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was faced with the prospect of going to COP26, and to be honest it was quite scary. What would we say? What did we really have to offer? Would we really be able to help? I had no idea. We didn’t even really know what we would be doing there. But at the same time, I was on fire with the aspiration that had been in my heart since I was a little boy—I had been searching my whole life for a way to help avert the present and future crises that we face, and now we had an opportunity to contribute.</p>
<p>Another memory… Every summer when I went to visit my grandparents in France, one of my favourite things to do was to lie down in the long grass, completely motionless, and just look. I would disappear into the weird and wonderful world of the colourful, shiny, metallic bugs, and big scary spiders with their bright yellow stripes; the drab grey grasshoppers, whose iridescent blue and red wings would only become visible when they were startled into jumping and fluttering to a new perch. But every time my grandfather mowed the grass, this rich and diverse world was destroyed. I never stopped trying to persuade him to let nature take its course and allow the field to grow and grow, undisturbed—to become a wild place again, full of life and wonder.</p>
<p>Just a few short days later I found myself in Glasgow, reunited with my mentor, teacher, elder brother and true friend on the path, Brother Phap Dung. It was such a joy to reconnect and share our excitement about what flavour of Dharma we wanted to offer —we stayed up late, sharing back and forth, and laughing a lot. In Edinburgh I had noticed that what touched people the most was seeing the <em>way</em> we operated as an organism - as one body. And as we talked, it became more and more clear that <em>this</em> was what we had confidence in: our practice of sangha interbeing-ness, our brotherhood and sisterhood. The world is being destroyed by individualism, competition and greed, and the medicine is the living insight of interbeing. So we made the determination to do our best to embody this insight, and to constantly take refuge in the felt, embodied sense of connection with our brothers and sisters, our teacher, our ancestors and the earth. We were determined not to be there as separate selves, but as two leaves at the tip of the branch, knowing that in truth we were much more than what can be seen with the eyes. <em><strong>We were not just two brothers, we were the whole tree, the roots, and the mycelial network which connects the whole forest.</strong></em> Any time I did not know what to say or do, I would do my best to light up this awareness, connecting myself with the Sangha - with the brothers and sisters, with Thay, with spiritual ancestors, and with Mother Earth herself - then everything became easier.</p>
<p>Sharing with the delegates at the conference, we were so happy to discover that the insight of interbeing and interdependence is also growing stronger in the world. Actually, in the environmental movement, almost <em>everyone</em> knows that this is the way forward, but what I started to see was that for many, this insight remains at the intellectual level and does not translate into their way of life. They understand the <em>principle</em> of interbeing, but they are still living as a separate self, as an individual who has to make a living, make a reputation for themselves - a career and an identity. But the good news is that when they <em>see</em> a practical example of how the insight can be applied, they get it right away. You just have to scratch the surface, and they are ready to transform. That’s the good news!</p>

<p>My greatest joy during those days in Glasgow was to see that Thay has given us everything we need to help these people take the next step. In the sangha, we are trained to live <em>together</em> and to rely on each other, and <em>interbeing</em> is alive at every level of our teaching and practice. All we need to do to transmit the insight of interbeing is to <em>be ourselves!</em> One thing people noticed was that they could not figure out who was the boss. They knew that Brother Phap Dung is the elder brother, so at first, they thought I was there to work out the logistics and he would do all the talking. But we did not operate like that. Every evening we would be cooking our Dharma, discussing what we felt had worked, reflecting on what we could still fine-tune, and just sharing our insights. The next day, it did not matter which mouth the insight came out of - there wasn’t the feeling of “hey, you used my line—that was <em>my</em> insight,” it was truly like we were one body with two mouths. We were operating as one and everyone could feel that. We were not doing anything special; it is just how we are trained in Plum Village, and what a contrast that makes with how most of the world operates. It really wakes people up. They start to see how interbeing is not just a concept but something that we can <em>live</em>.</p>
<p>One morning when I woke up, I could not stop smiling. I was lit up with gratitude to Thay - I felt so grateful <em>that we have something to offer and it works!</em> Thay has prepared everything so perfectly. He has offered us ways to teach and to practice which help <em>right away</em>. That is truly the greatest happiness. I later shared this simple insight with Brother Phap Dung, and in the sharing, the joy grew and grew, reflected back and forth between us.</p>
<p>That simple joy was <em>also</em> part of what we were offering. So many people are overwhelmed with despair and anxiety, especially in the environmental movement. They know more than most of us how bad things really are and the more they know, the worse it seems. At COP26, there was a very strong collective feeling of “time is running out,” and “it’s probably too late already”. Again and again, we would meet people, and within a few seconds they would break down in tears - not because they were sad, but because they could see and feel our joy, and the presence and joy of the Sangha through us. They could <em>see</em> that we were actually <em>living</em> the solution they sought and that immediately gave them hope. Our joy became their joy and they were able to continue their work in a new way. They were crying tears of <em>relief</em>, because now they could see that living in the insight of interbeing is something <em>possible,</em> not just a dream for the future.</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-phap-linhIMG0436crop" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-phap-linh/vk7nXfjp9H-2000.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>They were touched also by our (relative) non-fear of their suffering. We are all trained to listen to the suffering of others, so when people would share their suffering with us, we (mostly!) didn’t feel overwhelmed by it, and we knew (at least a little bit) how to help them to embrace it. And this is something that can only come from having faced some of our <em>own</em> suffering.</p>
<p>Every tiny step of transformation we have made on the path is directly connected with what we can offer to others. Every time we’ve been able to embrace some of our own sadness and confusion, every time we’ve been able to take a breath or two and soften a feeling of pain instead of reacting, every time we’ve been able to breathe through our anxiety or victimhood and liberate ourselves from it, even just a tiny bit - manifests as non-fear and confidence when we are with someone who is suffering. We know that it is possible to transform our own pain, that is why we know that it is also possible for someone else. The other person can feel that, and when they feel that non-fear from us, they already get some relief.</p>
<p>Our own transformation <em>is</em> the offering and as a sangha we have a <em>lot</em> to offer because <em>all</em> of us are walking that path, and all of us have been able to transform <em>something,</em> even if sometimes it feels like it’s not enough, and even though we still suffer now and then. Collectively, we transmit the lived experience of the transformation of suffering—the knowledge that it is possible—and that more than anything else is what the world needs right now.</p>
<p>In Glasgow, both Thầy Phap Dung and I felt so lucky that we get to do this work in this life—that we get to make a difference, just by living as a cell of the Sangha body. It is truly a great fortune, given the awareness of suffering in the world, and the awareness that the suffering may increase greatly in the coming years, to realise that <em>we can do something,</em> and that as a Sangha, <em>we can do a lot.</em></p>

            <div class="author">Brother Chân Pháp Niệm</div>
            <p>Brother Giác Thanh was one of the elder brothers of Plum Village. He lived in the <em>“Floating Cloud Hut”</em> on the hill looking towards the sunrise, right by Thầy’s <em>Sitting Still Hut, in Upper Hamlet</em>. That is why at times he was also called “<em>Brother Floating Cloud</em>”. In the early years when the <em>Fleurs de Cactus</em> Meditation Centre in Paris, which later became <em>La Maison de l’Inspir</em>, was first established, every month Br. Giác Thanh would go there for a weekend to teach and guide the lay friends. Then he would return to the Dharma Cloud Temple to help the younger brothers progress in their practice. That is why some also called him <em>“Brother Fleurs de Cactus”</em>.</p>
<p>Aside from the nicknames <em>“Brother Floating Cloud”</em> and <em>“Brother Fleurs de Cactus”</em> that some knew of, there was another name given by Thầy– <em>“Trà Sư” (Tea Master)</em>. Perhaps this is the name that everyone liked and associated with Br. Giác Thanh’s Zen Master style. He also really liked the name <em>“Floating Cloud”</em>. These two names captured his peace, freedom, and ease, and anyone who had a chance to approach him could enjoy these qualities because he always exuded a holy and pure energy. Friends from the west treasured him and loved being near him.</p>
<h2>The Seeker</h2>
<p>When I arrived in Plum Village on the 12<sup>th</sup> of June 1994 to be an aspirant, Br. Giác Thanh was already there. He first came to Plum Village in 1991, and I do not know much about his earlier years. I would just like to recount a few anecdotes and special moments from my time attending and learning from my elder brother.</p>
<p>The story of how he came to Plum Village, according to what I have heard, is very interesting. Br. Giác Thanh was someone who always sought to learn, especially about meditation. While still in Vietnam, he already learned meditation with Zen Master Thích Thanh Từ of Bamboo Forest Monastery (tu viện Trúc Lâm). At that time, his fellow students included Br. Thích Minh Nghĩa (now the Abbot of Toàn Giác Monastery and also Giác Nguyên Ancestral Temple), Br. Thích Phước Tịnh, who is now at Deer Park Monastery, and many others. Those who wish to know more about Br. Giác Thanh should come to the above-mentioned venerable monks, especially the Venerable Phước Tịnh.</p>
<p>While searching for a teacher, as far as I know, Br. Giác Thanh was keen to learn, sincere, spacious, and someone who is not caught in the form. As for certain work skills, or Zen rituals, perhaps he was not so proficient. He focused all his energy on the practice and preferred a quiet, contemplative life. He always had a burning desire to learn and to realize the essence of Zen. Br. Giác Thanh wandered everywhere wanting to learn, even after coming to the west. Whenever he heard of a well-known meditation master, whether lay or monastic, he would come to learn meditation with them. It is said that he even visited female lay meditation masters to learn methods of meditation. This shows the extent of his desire to learn and his free, unconventional spirit. He meditated diligently for long periods of time, reflecting in silence, hoping to realize the essence of  Zen. Perhaps Br. Giác Thanh often went into deep concentration and completely unaware about his body. It is also perhaps because of this that whenever he sat in deep concentration, even while listening to Thầy’s teaching, he often rolled his head back and forth without realizing it. Every time Thầy saw this, Thầy would call out: “Brother Giác Thanh, open your eyes! Don’t keep your eyes closed in concentration!” Hearing Thầy, Br. Giác Thanh opened his eyes and his head stopped rolling.</p>
<h2>The End of Wandering and Seeking</h2>
<p>Br. Giác Thanh was searching for a teacher. One day while visiting family in Canada, he met Thầy at a retreat in Maple Village, Montreal, Canada. Autumn in North America with its brilliant colours is always magnificent beyond words. One can only be silent and enjoy it, fully enjoy it. During one walking meditation, Thầy and the sangha stopped, sat down on the grass to bathe in the Fall colours, and drank tea. Br. Giác Thanh sat next to Thầy. Amidst that wondrous reality Thầy pointed at the radiant Autumn forest and said: “Br. Giác Thanh, that which you have been searching for so long is right there! There it is! This is it!” Those instructive words were the last drop of water leading to an overflow, creating an opening, a loosening in Br. Giác Thanh’s mind, reaching a wonderful state of freedom. The happiness of that taste of freedom was immense. Perhaps only he could feel it clearly and no one else can possibly describe it. From then on, he truly stopped searching. He took refuge in Thầy as his teacher until he passed away. Since that Autumn, whenever the younger ones thought of Br. Giác Thanh, we couldn’t help but sing <em>“One maple leaf falls”</em> as an offering to him. He really liked that song.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One maple leaf falls<br/>
My dear, do you hear it?<br/>
One maple leaf falls<br/>
Autumn returns with its beauty.<br/>
A thousand leaves are falling<br/>
Amber, crimson, gold<br/>
A thousand leaves are falling<br/>
Soaring across the sky.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the years of learning from him and drinking tea by his side, I heard from Br. Giác Thanh that before coming to Plum Village, he had a dream. In it, he was lying down and saw an old woman by the foot of his bed. She looked at him with very gentle, kind, and bright eyes, and said: “Come home my child”. Later when he met Thầy, he saw that the old woman in the dream looked very much like Thầy, and he was certain that she was no other than Thầy. It is precisely due to these predestined conditions that Br. Giác Thanh always held Thầy in his heart with much respect and love, in a quiet and infinitely lovely way.</p>
<p>The story of awakening while viewing the Autumn splendor may remind us of the story of Zen master Lingyun Zhiqin (<em>Master “Sacred Cloud”</em>). One morning he woke to blooming peach blossoms and became suddenly enlightened. Many doubts in his mind were dispelled and he touched the nature of life, of oneself. The master had spent thirty years to find the <em>master swordsman,</em> that is, finding one's original face, one's true nature. Peach blossoms bloom, the Zen master sees.</p>
<blockquote lang="zh">三十年來尋剑客</br>
几回落叶又抽枝</br>
自从一见桃花后</br>
直至如今更不疑</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For thirty years I've sought the swordsman
Many times the leaves have fallen to sprout anew.
Following one glance at a peach blossom,
I no longer have any more doubts.<span class="note">Translated by Andy Ferguson. In: Zen's Chinese Heritage: The Masters and Their Teachings, Wisdom Publications, 2000, pp. 183-184.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thầy offered a pair of parallel verses to Br. Giác Thanh when he passed away:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One maple leaf has fallen down, and yet you continue to climb the hill of the 21<sup>st</sup> century with us.<br/>Thousands of daffodils are beginning to bloom and the earth continues to be with the sky, singing the song of no-birth and no-death.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Putting on the Robe of Freedom</h2>
<p>There was quite a long period of time when Br. Giác Thanh went <em>“sanghati free”</em>. He came to precept recitations wearing just the long robe, or even just short robes covered with an O.I. jacket. The abbot at that time was extremely upset. Every time he saw Br. Giác Thanh, an elder brother, coming to the precepts recitation <em>“sanghati free”</em>, he showed his displeasure. Of course the unhappiness of the abbot, the second oldest brother in the sangha, was understandable. It was his responsibility to guide the sangha towards order, and not unrestrained “free style”. Knowing this, as much as the abbot was displeased and respectfully asked Br. Giác Thanh to wear his sanghati for the precepts recitation, to be a mirror for the younger ones, he remained <em>sanghati free</em>.</p>
<p>I was a young monk at the time, so I just lightly noted what was happening, I was not qualified to say anything. Thầy must have heard the complaints and knew about it, but somehow he acted as if nothing had happened. The other brothers also knew, but no one complained and no one followed suit. The fact was that Thầy was Br. Giác Thanh's teacher. If Thầy said nothing, how could we? Only Thầy and Br. Giác Thanh understood each other at that level. Maybe that is why Thầy said nothing. In the end, Br. Giác Thanh was still Br. Giác Thanh, <em>sanghati free</em>.</p>
<p>Spring in the west is incredibly beautiful. Come winter, the forest sheds all its leaves, leaving only bare branches and appearing as if dead. But after three months of sleep, the buds and shoots burst through rapidly and emerge as green leaves in just a short while. The forest was a tender green and full of life. There were times in spring when Br. Giác Thanh would sit on the deck of the <em>Floating Cloud Hut</em> and mutter: “My sanghati is the vast sky and earth, the green of nature,  every day, I wear it at all times…”</p>
<p>Br. Giác Thanh has transcended false appearances into a signless reality that only he could deeply feel. Thầy understood him. Though in form he did not wear the sanghati but in content, in the heart of one who has reached the signless reality he always wore the sanghati. He wore the robe of liberation that cannot be seen or known by others except for Thầy. The stillness and freedom of zen masters are expressed in myriad ways. The special thing that everyone knows is - we cannot truly become them by mere mimic. If we try to mimic them, invariably we will be dealt a “zen stick”.</p>
<h2>Solid and Free</h2>
<p>The Upper Hamlet in the early days when I first came was still very rustic. The material conditions and infrastructure were still quite poor. There were only about 15 monks at the time. We lived happily and contentedly together. On freezing winter days, the unsealed bedrooms just had a small wood-fired stove [for heating] and a bed made of one sheet of plywood placed on four bricks. We lit the stove before going to bed. But by the middle of the night the wood ran out, the stove was cold, and huddled in our flimsy sleeping bags, we were also cold. Getting up in the morning was always a huge challenge. We had to be very <em>Heroic</em>. If we wanted to get up, we had to do so right away! We danced around and moved our bodies for a while before bravely heading out to wash our face, brush our teeth, and then go for the morning practice session.</p>
<p>The old meditation hall was originally a cow shed. It did not have a fireplace and the walls were built of limestone. Even though it was icy cold, the brothers diligently continued the morning and evening meditations. Upper Hamlet had a small kitchen with an attic above it which was the monks' dining room. The dining tables were arranged in a square so that while eating, the brothers could see each other and practice being present for each other.</p>
<p>One morning, after two sounds of the bell to end the silent meal, one younger brother (who was a very impatient person) stood up on the side opposite Br. Giác Thanh. Before anyone else could stand up, he shocked everyone by heavily insulting Br. Giác Thanh. As a younger brother, I couldn't believe another young one could insult our eldest brother like that. For whatever reason he was so angry and was yelling: “Zen master? What kind of a zen master are you? You are shit, pee pee … !” When I looked over to Br. Giác Thanh I was even more surprised. He sat and ate calmly, peaceful, free, entirely unmoved by the insults. He looked at his younger brother with compassion and understanding. The other elder brothers intervened and dragged the young brother out of the dining room. I thought something big was going to happen.</p>
<p>But everything flowed smoothly as if nothing had happened. Perhaps Br. Giác Thanh did not allow the abbot to force the young one to apologize. Perhaps he left the matter for the other brothers to handle. Br. Giác Thanh was by nature tolerant, spacious, and always wished for things to be simpler. A few days later, the young monk went by his own will to Br. Giác Thanh's hut, put on his sanghati and touched the earth in repentance for his ignorance. Br. Giác Thanh did not allow him to prostrate. Instead, he asked him to take off his sanghati and sit down to drink tea with him. Br. Giác Thanh shared, listened, and guided the young monk in a gentle way. Right after that, it was as if nothing had ever happened. That incident gave me firmer trust that liberation, awakening is real; it is something we can witness with our own eyes and not just something to be read in books. I am happy to have had a chance to be near such an elder brother.</p>
<h2>Nothing is Born, Nothing Dies</h2>
<p>Once while being Br. Giác Thanh's attendant, I accidentally broke one of his tea cups from an antique set that he really treasured. Br. Giác Thanh was a tea master. Tea masters always had good tea and precious tea pots. But he only had that one set. One day, Br. Giác Thanh was washing his tea set on the deck of his hut and asked me to find a dishwashing sponge. When I brought it to him my toe accidentally touched one of the four cups, it rolled away, then suddenly broke into two. I was so scared! My face went ashen and my body shook uncontrollably. Seeing this, Br. Giác Thanh quickly picked up the two broken pieces and hid them behind his back. <em>“Huh! Nothing is broken. Isn't that right my child? This cup has never been broken. It pretends to be broken. But how can it be? Everything comes together due to conditions and then hides due to conditions. Its nature is non-broken.”</em> I was scared and felt so sorry because I knew he really loved those cups. But after hearing his words my heart was lightened. He compassionately took away my fear and even taught me the no-birth, no-death nature of the tea cup. That was a lesson I would never forget. Br. Giác Thanh really treasured the tea set, but he was also ready at any moment to let it go.</p>
<h2>The Cute Inner Child</h2>
<p>For a long time Br. Giác Thanh did not go for walking meditation with the sangha. Severe diabetes had hit him. Apart from being Thầy's attendant, I also took care of Br. Giác Thanh's food and laundry for two years. An ordinary person could not possibly eat his food because it did not have any seasoning, not even salt. I had to be very creative to make inspiring dishes. Br. Giác Thanh ate very well, but no matter how well one eats or how hard one tries, one still gets bored. One time he was incredibly bored by the food and somehow, found a packet of instant noodles and secretly made it. I caught him and tried to stop him from eating it. Br. Giác Thanh said: “Pháp Niệm, let your elder brother eat just one packet to ease the boredom.” I could not stop him. Actually I was only pretending to stop him because I knew he had been so very bored of his food.</p>
<p>Once Br. Giác Thanh had swollen ankles and could not walk easily unless he really tried. Because he did not go for walking meditation for many months, Thầy personally visited him and asked him to come walk with the sangha. Br. Giác Thanh said his legs hurt and he could not walk. He thought this way, Thầy would leave him alone. But who would have expected Thầy to pressure him to go for walking meditation? Thầy scolded him lightly and told him he had to walk outdoors for his legs to heal. Not daring to disobey Thầy, Br. Giác Thanh managed to follow Thầy's instructions. But he harboured the thought: “Yes, ok, let's go. I will walk and let my legs swell up, then you will see… Already there is no pity. Then even forcing me to go walking meditation!” But after walking with the sangha for about one week a miracle occurred - his swelling went down, his legs healed and he could walk easily again. Br. Giác Thanh was very surprised and he exclaimed: “Huh! The old man is scary!” We all have a little child in us no matter how old we are. And that inner child is innocent and uniquely beautiful.</p>
<h2>The Song of Immortality</h2>
<p>In 2001 during Thầy's teaching tour in China we received the news that Br. Giác Thanh had passed away. Thầy and the brothers and sisters held a memorial service on the bus because the tour schedule was so busy. In his last years, Br. Giác Thanh was appointed by Thầy to be the abbot of Deer Park Monastery. He was a superb abbot, working during the day and lying down to rest in the evening. He wore a dialysis bag for 12 hours. Everyone loved him so much.</p>
<p>Deer Park Monastery is in Southern California. For some unknown reason, when Br. Giác Thanh went there to be the abbot, he started to wear his sanghati again. “At every point, be sovereign of yourself. Wherever you stand, be your true person.” (Master Linji - <span lang="zh">随处作主,立处皆真</span>). Depending on the place, the situation, the people, Br. Giác Thanh knew how to respond appropriately. Everything is manifestation. For him <em>holding on or letting go, he was free.</em> A free person is not caught in any form or sign, even “signlessness”. In the Diamond Sutra it says: “Subhuti, if you think that the Tathagata realizes the highest, most fulfilled, awakened mind and does not need to use all the signs, you are wrong. Subhuti, do not think in that way.”</p>
<p>At Deer Park Monastery on the side of the mountain, a memorial stupa was erected for Br. Giác Thanh and in the heart of it is engraved a posthumous poem written for him by Thầy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That you are a virtuous one is already heard by everyone
The work of a true practitioner has been accomplished
When you stupa has just been raised on the hillside
The sound of children's laughter will already be heard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Br. Giác Thanh was truly a hero, a great man. He had accomplished the most worthy deed of a practitioner - the career of awakening. He built his stupa not with stones but with liberation, awakening, solidity, and freedom, and we continue to benefit from them. That stupa is also his sangha. In the years since Br. Giác Thanh passed away, many young people, both Vietnamese and American, have come to practise and ordain at Deer Park Monastery. They are all his continuations. The laughter of innocence, joy, and freedom still echoes in those endless skies.</p>
<p>There are many who can recount more wonderful moments with Br. Giác Thanh, more so than I. Whenever I sit down to make a pot of tea I remember him through the vivid Dharma sounds that resonate in my mind, and the warm cups of tea he taught me to drink with awareness. Ha! See? Br. Giác Thanh is still there in each of us teasing us, and drinking tea with us. Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>
<p>With my deepest respect to my beloved elder brother Giác Thanh,
Chân Pháp Niệm</p>

            <h1 id="chicken-and-egg" class="chapter">Chicken and Egg</h1>
            <div class="author">Brother Chân Pháp Ứng</div>
            <p>The never-broken transmission of the love between teacher and disciple through many generations, including the World-Honored One, is real. I have received our grandfather teacher’s love for Thay, his disciple, in a way that I can feel. It manifested during a retreat that was very difficult for me.</p>
<p>At that time I had only practised for four, five years and my practice was not yet stable. The sangha nominated me and another novice brother to lead a retreat in Germany. It was a five-day retreat for Vietnamese and German people. The retreatants shared their deep sufferings and some even expressed suicidal thoughts. I cried during a Dharma talk knowing my own capacity was still weak. I was like a lost child who cried to seek help from the spiritual energy of our ancestral teachers.</p>
<p>The retreat somehow unfolded wonderfully. During the ceremony to express gratitude to the Three Jewels, as I touched the earth with the sangha I suddenly felt without my knowing it, that grandfather teacher was there supporting me throughout the whole retreat. In that moment, all the stress, all the worries dissolved. I felt grandfather teacher's love in its entirety. That love was received by Thay and passed on to me. Grandfather teacher held me in his heart. That love made me light, strong, and filled with humility.</p>
<p>After the retreat we held a Day of Mindfulness for Vietnamese and German people. The walking meditation took place under a beautiful autumn sun. I held the hand of a young Vietnamese child. She walked and played, kicking up the leaves. As the one leading the walking meditation, I held my posture upright and solemn. Suddenly I thought: &quot;Why don't I let myself play a little with my feet and the leaves?&quot; My body and mind opened at that thought and I could be myself. I did not need to be tense. I heard Thay's voice from the depths of my heart: &quot;<em>Thay does not ask for anything more. Thay just wants you to be happy.&quot;</em>  I was very grateful for that voice.</p>
<p>Through that experience, I realized that the stories between grandfather teacher and Thay are manifesting in a very real way. When Thay was still a novice monk at the Root Temple, one day, both teacher and disciple were working together. After working a while in the heat, grandfather teacher, wearing his conical hat, straightened up. He was tired and sweating profusely from work. Turning around to look at Thay, he said: &quot;I'm quite tired. I guess when I die I will stop being tired.&quot; Often we believe that when we die we will leave behind our loved ones and go to another world; we will no longer be held back by the things of this world and we are free. That is why we say, &quot;I'm tired. When I die I will stop being tired.&quot; Thay did not understand his teacher's words. He was still only a novice. Grandfather teacher looked at him again and said: &quot;But if I die, then <em>who</em> will be tired?&quot; The word &quot;who&quot; here is very important. Grandfather teacher saw very clearly, just as we do, that the love between teacher and disciple transcends time. Grandfather teacher had the insight of interbeing. He was not limited by life and death. That is why grandfather teacher is always present with Thay and with his descendants for this life and for lives to come. It is thanks to that ceaseless continuation and transmission that we are still cradled by the love and care of generations of ancestral teachers.</p>
<p>Thay received that saying like a koan from his teacher, and with his meditation practice over the years, finally broke through it like a chick hatching from an egg. In the west there is a seemingly very philosophical question - <em>Which came first, the chicken or the egg</em>? But when we ask which came first, we are in fact caught in the idea that the chicken and the egg are two separate entities. According to the insight of Buddhism, there is a very intimate relationship between the chicken and the egg that cannot be separated or divided. The chicken and the egg are present at the same time and are in each other. That is called &quot;no birth&quot; in Buddhist terms. The chicken manifests from the egg, the egg manifests from the chicken. This is no birth and no death.</p>
<p>Thay has put this insight into practice: I have arrived, I am home. In the here and in the now. The door of no birth is already open. For Thay, that insight is very clear and he has nourished and transmitted it to so many people around the world, both monastic and lay. It is thanks to that insight that we can practise to have true love, true peace, and true happiness. Our true home is here, is now, is everywhere.</p>
<p>When we are alive, we train ourselves to live in the present moment, in our true home. When we die, we also die in the present moment, in our true home. It is with this insight that Thay is able to dwell in the present moment. <em>This moment</em> is beyond time. <em>This moment</em> contains the three times. One day when periodic impermanence<span class="note">There is momentary impermanence and periodic impermanence. Momentary impermanence is the constant changing of our cells, our feelings and loved ones, like a river with the same name but the water in it is constantly changing. Periodic impermanence is like the changing stages of our life, childhood, teenage, adulthood, old age and death.</span> occurs, we will witness what we will temporarily call the &quot;death&quot; of Thay. The reality however, is that Thay's ability to dwell in mindfulness, concentration, and insight will continue to help him be truly present in the here, in the now, and in the true home. This is why Thay is here for us, for now and for lifetimes to come. This is also why the Buddhas and ancestral teachers are always here for us and we know that the lineage has never been and will never be broken. <em>This is</em> the insight of interbeing.</p>
<p>I remember one time, a sister encountered many difficulties and wanted to return to lay life. Thay could not help her and I saw he also suffered. During one Dharma talk, Thay said: &quot;My child, Thay will be there for you for a thousand life times.&quot; &quot;A thousand life times&quot; is just a customary way to speak about time. It means Thay is always present for you, now and forever. Thay has that insight and the ability to dwell in mindfulness, concentration, and insight. We are receiving the heritage of the Buddhas, the ancestral teachers, and of Thay. We are each in some aspect their continuation.</p>
<p>If we think a little further, when Thay <em>dies</em>, <em>where</em> could we be in touch with Thay? The answer is - in every breath, in every step, in each one of us, right in the present moment and right in the midst of life. We should not think that Thay will enter nirvana and be somewhere else or that Thay will be born again in another form. Those thoughts are just conventional views. The view transmitted to us by Thay is that he is present right here, right now, in life, and in all of us. Thay has repeated countless times for us to carve that insight into our hearts and bones. It is expressed in the poem &quot;<em>Please call me by my true names</em>&quot;. Thay's true name is also birds, ants, this person, that person, and the insight of inclusiveness. Thay is life, Thay is here, Thay is in all the manifestations of suffering and happiness. He has never been born and has never died. If we are able to maintain that insight then we will always have Thay. Along with the Buddhas and ancestral teachers of countless generations, Thay will continue to lead us on the path of practice.</p>

            <p>I feel privileged to have Thay as my teacher and to have the opportunity to be fully trained as a monastic in the Plum Village Monastic order. I have learned a lot since I arrived in Plum Village in October 2009. This was the period of time when I left behind my professional life in Indonesia and aspired to live a contemplative life with a very inspiring teacher and a very engaged practice community. I have been learning and relearning a lot of things in Plum Village such as meditation, the way to love and to reconcile with myself and my blood family, community living, monastic training, applied Buddhism, and how to practice engaging with the world outside of the monastery.</p>
<p>I am happy for my community in its 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary because the community is capable of continuing the legacy of our teacher, Thay, and  continues to engage in creating peace through the path of understanding and love in many aspects of life: young people, families, leaders, teachers, health, science, climate and social injustice. I have been enjoying the many teachings given by our elder monastic siblings and I am also inspired by how many of them bring their deep insight into engaging with society.</p>
<h2>The Rainbow Family of Plum Village</h2>
<p>Since the Wake Up Retreat in 2016, I have been engaged in a Plum Village practice community who calls themselves the “Rainbow Family”. This is a community that consists of people with diverse gender indentities and sexual orientations, LGBTIAQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Questioning, Intersex, Asexual and also includes the diverse spectrums of gender and orientation). Among much suffering that is happening in the world, people who are identifed as LGBTQIA+, until today, still live with many different degrees of suffering and discrimination from unconscious judgements of family and society, to living under a death threat by law in many countries. This suffering is simply because they are doing their best to be beautiful, to be themselves, and because of the way they love each other. As a rainbow monastic, at the beginning, it was also very hard for me to practice “<em>to be beautiful, to be myself”</em> because this has not yet been accepted fully in the collective consciousness of humans. Seeing all the suffering happening in the rainbow community, I felt the urge to come out and engage with the community, to offer my practice, my presence, with my aspiration to learn together and to understand more deeply.</p>
<h2>Joyfully together as a Rainbow Family</h2>
<p>Today we have many “Rainbow Families” around the world, such as France (Sangha Queer Paris and Marseille) , Rainbow UK, Rainbow Ireland, Rainbow Sangha Indonesia, Germany (Berlin and Freiburg), US (Chrysanthemum and Cosmic Body), International LGBTIAQ+ Sangha and the PlumVillage App. All of these communities are spaces for practicing mindfulness in the Plum Village tradition and a for refuge for our lay and monastics practitioners that identify as LGBTQIA+. Some monastic siblings and I have participated in many of these sanghas’ activities. It is very inspiring to see many people of all ages with very diverse gender and sexual orientations come together to share the practice, enjoy each other’s transformation and nourish each other whether it is an in-person or online retreat.</p>
<p>Rainbow lay practitioners, Order of interbeing members and monastics work hand in hand to build a spiritual family. Family is a safe space and a refuge. There are many allies who also come and help to build the community, because they have been supporting their loved ones, their father, their mother, their son, their daughter, their cousins, their friends, who might be suffering because they identify themselves as LGBTIAQ+ and face discrimination and other difficulties.</p>
<p>I have been able to participate in multiple LGBTIAQ+ retreats in Plum Village Tradition, in Dharma sharings, in EIAB, in Mountagne du Dharma, in online retreats. Every retreat or Dharma sharing always brings healing to people, lay or monastics. This is because everyone of us faces more or less the same difficulty in being ourselves and being happy.</p>
<h2>Watering the seeds of awareness in the monastic community</h2>
<p>For me, continuous right diligence is necessary to water the seeds of understanding, compassion, and awareness, so that there is more understanding in our engaged monastic community about LGBTIAQ+ concerns. I really hope we shall continue to be a refuge for this community.</p>
<p>The Plum Village Monastic order is a real engaged Buddhist community, I was invited, on a Rains Retreat 2021 monastic day, to offer workshop on “<em>Understanding LGBTIAQ+”</em>. It was a very joyful moment, there were more than 60 monastics that came together with their open hearts, with the aspiration to understand and to find ways to support the LGBTIAQ+ practitioners. I felt so touched by the presence and the curiosity of my monastic siblings, monks and nuns.</p>
<p>In the Bhikshu community, there have been several sharings on this topic with the same spirit of openness, to find ways to support LGBTQIA+ practitioners. Upper Hamlet, where I live now, has been very supportive in allowing a Rainbow Dharma sharing once a month. This is with the full support of the Upper Hamlet Dharma Teacher Council, who has witnessed what we sometimes have had to struggle with to make a Rainbow Dharma sharing possible.</p>
<h2>Deep Looking</h2>
<p>Human beings, when they find themselves different from the majority and on the top of it all, see that people in their environment do not show acceptance and understanding, can find life very tough. This is especially so for young people (children and teenagers) who have never received any information that they are fine to be different. They have to figure out what is happening to them alone, and at the same time they have to face their family and society, where most of the time are not very kind to them. Many out of despair and pain take their own lives or suffer by themselves on a daily basis for a very long time. I, myself, went through that kind of shock when I discovered that I was not heterosexual, until my school teachers told me that it was fine and that I still had a chance to love and to be loved like every body else and that I would be fine. Without these people I would not have been able to find peace in myself, especially since I am from Indonesia.</p>
<p>I have been asking myself why I want to be engaged in the Rainbow community, and I have not been able to find the exact answer, as I am not a LGBTIAQ+ activist. However one thing is clear to me and that is that I have the aspiration to relieve suffering and contribute to the growth of humanity. The Plum Village Rainbow Family is a very safe space for Rainbow practitioners, lay and monastic. It is a space where we can share who we are and how we are without external pressures. The community provides a space where we can look deeply into ourselves and also into what is happening in society.</p>
<p>LGBTIAQ+ people are not enemies to anyone but we are just unfamiliar friends to family and society. This is the insight that I have in my practice. This has given me freedom to allow people to be homophobic, to allow people to have prejudice against Rainbow people, and to allow them to take their time to transform. The existence of the Rainbow family will help to transform homophobia and prejudice, especially in the Plum Village Community worldwide. Our Teacher always teaches us to take care of ourselves first, so the Plum Village community needs to transform itself first before we can reach out fully. The existence of the Rainbow Family also makes the Rainbow Family become familiar friends to as many people as possible. This will bring peace and happiness to oneself, family and society.</p>
<h2>Planting seeds for future generations</h2>
<p>My aspiration, as a Rainbow monk, is first of all to live a life of freedom and to help people to live in freedom too, including the LGBTIAQ+ siblings, lay and monastic. We all have Buddha nature, we all have beauty in us. I would like to see Rainbow people live happily and free and love according to who they are. I also would like to support my Rainbow monastic siblings to live happily and free as monastics, to be able to practice the precepts and cultivate merit and virtue so that we can continue the legacy of the Buddha and our teacher, Thay.</p>
<p>In Plum Village I have had a chance to study the classical Vinaya, both Pali and Chinese translated in English, and surprisingly I discovered that in the time of the Buddha, the topic of gender had been part of the Buddha's sangha life. When I read the paragraph in the Vinaya<span class="note">Dharmaguptaka Vinaya: Ordination Skandhaka, part 5. Taisho Vol. 22 pp. 812-816, Bodhi.</span> stating that when a monk who had been ordained as a bhikshu for some time became a woman, and the Buddha said that she should join the bhikshuni sangha and keep her place in order of ordination. The same happened for a bhikshuni who became a man, I felt light at heart because I felt that a man can be female and a woman can be male and it does not mean that that person has to be expelled from the sangha. These accounts give me a lot of confidence in the Buddha’s teaching and His community and also in the inclusiveness of the Plum Village monastic community.</p>
<p>When I contemplate the future Plum Village Monastic Community, I would love to see that we all will continue to practice the Monastic Mindfulness trainings (pratikmoksha), mindful breathing and walking, to build togetherness, brotherhood, sisterhood and siblinghood. A community that continues to contribute peace and healing to society, transforming suffering. A community that has more diversity in the monastic and lay community such as more nationalities, more ethnicities, more people of color, more diversity in gender and diverse sexual orientations.</p>
<p>And one day LGBTIAQ+ people will be familiar friends to themselves, family, society, nation and the world and at the end we will not need the LGBTIAQ+ community or Rainbow Family anymore because we are just part of human beings who are not seen to be different from anyone else. This is the deep aspiration that I have.</p>

            <div class="author">Brother Chân Trời Đại Đạo</div>
            <h2>Workshops on the Environment</h2>
<p>I love Mother earth, and I cannot look at documentaries on the environment crisis without feeling despair and powerlessness. It was with this backdrop that a chain of events happened which empowered me not to give up hope but to do what we can, where we are, with what we have got, to help Mother earth. Perhaps Mother earth can be a verb as well as a noun, perhaps we have to nurture and care for the land that is looking up at us needing our love.</p>
<p>During the Rains retreat of 2019 we had a series of workshops on the environment to see how we could reduce our carbon footprint and recycling, which completely changed the way I saw rubbish. As part of the workshops we started looking at what we were throwing out to see how we could reduce our carbon footprint and the amount of waste we were exporting out of the monastery. The mindset we had at the time was to take everything to the recycling centre by van. We didn’t give much thought to what happened to it next. It was someone else’s problem.</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-troi-dai-daoIMG0428" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-troi-dai-dao/9cLFnJ6M2s-2000.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>The workshops showed us what happened next, and so we saw that vast amounts of things are not recycled and saw a documentary about a Japanese town that had achieved zero waste through the collective efforts of the whole community. They had succeeded in building a collective recycling centre that tried to re-use everything. are buried in the earth in huge pits. Even things that are recycled are not processed locally but are transported on to other larger plants, creating more carbon. Therefore it seemed clear that by looking into what we could process here ourselves we would reduce a whole chain of transport by fossil fuel burning vehicles but also reduce the amount of stuff buried in the earth.</p>
<p>When we study the ten links we see that through our ignorance we see things as separate formations and we do not see the interrelation between things. We see a log on the fire but we do not see the chainsaw that cut it up or the fossil fuels burnt in that cutting action. We see a tee-shirt but not the amount of water that was used to make it. It is also easy for us to get rid of things and not concern ourselves about what will become of them or our planet as a result. Can we see the future of the packaging of items we order or buy in the shop? It is hard to include its continuation in our choice of each item.</p>
<h2>Harvesting rainwater</h2>
<p>During those workshops we had one group focus on water and how much water we use unnecessarily. Our revolution began right there. I slowly began to notice that we had several large rainwater collectors lying around and not being used. Little by little we started collecting them to gutters and before long we had 5 rainwater collectors harvesting a total of 2,500 litres of rainwater. It cost us almost nothing just our labour since we had pipes salvaged from reconstruction projects.</p>
<p>With this in place, we noticed that once the containers were full we could not harvest any more rainwater next time it rained. Around the same time we started to buy cooking oil in 25litre plastic containers and they eventually started arriving in recycling. So we began cleaning them and filling them from the rainwater collectors. Our rainwater tanks became rain cows that we could endlessly milk.</p>
<p>What are we doing with all that water? If you are planting trees it is very convenient to have lots of portable containers of water. Also we have an outside tap next to the monastic residence. Son Ha is at the bottom of a hill and gets very muddy when the rains come. The brothers were using this outside tap to wash the mud off their boots after walking. So we put one rainwater collector there with a tap and now we use the rainwater to clean our boots so we save on tapwater.</p>
<p>Two other collectors were set up to take the run off rainwater from our barn’s roof. We use this to process our waste cardboard and to water the flowers in the garden.</p>
<h2>Driving less</h2>
<p>When we looked at what kind of waste we were driving in our fossil fuel burning van to the local recycling centre we found that it was mostly cardboard and glass. Not only were we driving this cardboard and glass to the recycling centre while burning diesel, but it was not being processed there. So it would all go on another fossil fuel burning journey to a bigger centre to be processed. I like cycling and decided to cycle all the glass up to the nearby bottle bank in Puyguilhem at the top of the hill. This is good for my health, good for the environment and empowering me to feel I am doing something to help.</p>
<h2>Composting and making cardboard logs</h2>
<p>Now we shred some of the cardboard by hand and add it to weeds or grass cuttings to make a rich compost which we store in empty rice sacks of which we have a regular supply from the garden. Witnessing this alchemy of turning grass and cardboard to air the mix and seeing the red worms come and eventually the pile transformed into dark brown compost is very fulfilling.</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-troi-dai-daoIMG0411crop" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-troi-dai-dao/-2GReiFoUd-2000.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>The wastepaper and unglossy cardboard are cut up and soaked in rainwater before being pulped, mixed with sawdust from our woodwork area and compressed into logs for the fire. It can be difficult sometimes to get everyone on board with the idea that separating sawdust from other floor sweepings is helping the environment. But patience pays off. We made the log press from an old car jack and bits of scrap metal.</p>
<p>At first the logs were too long so they either bent over or comically slumped in the drying process. Actually when I think back the very first ones I made were so small it took too much effort to make them for the end result, so that’s why I started making them longer. In addition they are so fragile while still wet, that I broke many just turning them over through their drying stage. Gradually we found the best length to diameter ratio to make them efficient to make and able to manoeuvre and dry naturally in wind and sun. The learning and correcting process was frustrating at the time but also empowering.</p>
<p>This synergy of rainwater harvesting, and cardboard, sawdust and garden waste recycling turns a lot of waste into useful things, keeps us warm and helps us grow trees and plants. We also reduce the amount of wooden logs we need and thereby the amount of chainsaw use and produce less smoke particles from our chimneys. Also the seasons affect everything so it’s harder to make compost in midwinter as there is no green stuff to mix in and the temperature is cold. In autumn the rains make it very easy.</p>
<h2>Repurposing containers – Introducing the tetrapot</h2>
<p>For two years we struggled to find a solution to the vast numbers of tetrapaks we were putting into our yellow recycling bags. Looking deeply into the problem we saw that a third of the volume of our yellow recycling bags was taken up by tetrapaks from vegan milk. We cannot crush them as the recycling centre can only process them uncrushed. From time to time I would try to think of a solution to this issue - sometimes quite laughable ideas, but always in vain. Eventually I kept this problem in the back of my mind waiting for the answer to come.</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-troi-dai-daoIMG0430" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-troi-dai-dao/JZw686OgcT-2000.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>One day we were invited to help plant pumpkin seeds on our organic farm. We were planting the seeds into fragile unrecyclable black plastic pots. They kept breaking as we put the compost in. There was the solution! – if we cut a tetrapak in half and make a hole in the bottom half we have two planting pots which we had been buying, and they can be used more than once. The Happy farm were keen to try it out as an experiment and so a new life was given to thousands of tetrapaks we use every year. We are also using them to plant many different trees. The tetrapot was born!</p>
<p>With every project there are teething problems. We have to clean the pots really thoroughly as rodents are attracted to traces of milk in the pots and are very happy to munch big holes in the sides of our pots. We have to ask everyone not to crush the tetrapaks. As for all the lids they are the subject of a future recycling project.</p>
<h2>From waste to resource</h2>
<p>What we are discovering is that once you start to look at things not as waste but as a potential resource you create the conditions for finding what that resource will be useful for. It has been hugely empowering to see what we, a small community, can do for the environment using only what we have to hand. The revolution continues.</p>
<p>At the moment it is very clear to me that we need to separate more stuff in bins. Our ability to repurpose waste revolves around it being separated. This is unpopular as it means we have to think more about where to put each waste item. However, it is the only way we have found to practice recycling and repurposing. Our online shop for example has to send all its products by mail. So we started a new bin just for cardboard envelopes and bubblewrap envelopes. Now that all goes to the online shop for re-use. Without the extra bin it’s not easy.</p>
<p>We are lucky in our community to have a lot of different functions; farm, office, shop etc. But wherever we live we are part of a wider community where these functions exist. We receive wooden crates from vegetables for example. Originally I cut them up in a table saw to make kindling for the fire. Then a brother shared about taking them to a local grower. So now we take them to a local market garden for re-use. That way they buy less new ones. So some stuff gets repurposed here and some is done outside here. We just keep looking out for opportunities and the mind of recycling develops naturally.</p>

            <!-- Wake Up is a Precious Gem of the Plum Village Tradition -->
<!-- Calligraphy by Thay Phap Huu -->
<!-- Offering the Wake Up song for Thay and the Sangha -->
<!-- Wake Up Indonesia with sarong and batik -->
<p>As a young person, I didn’t know what I really wanted to do with my life. I didn’t have a path. When I heard that Thay was coming to Indonesia in 2010, I immediately signed up for the retreat. After the retreat had finished, I felt that I had seen the path I wanted to embark on it. Yes, I wanted to become a monk! My parents didn’t support me but after they had witnessed my transformation, they understood that this path would bring me a lot of happiness. They asked me to finish my studies, I thought it was a good idea also, so that I could really reflect deeply on my aspiration, to see if this path would help me to find meaning in my life.</p>
<p>After the retreat in 2010, some young people who were at the retreat decided to establish Wake Up Indonesia. The Wake Up movement has helped many young people to find a path in their life. In 2013, some of my friends and I from Wake Up Indonesia went on the Wake Up Retreat led by Thay in Thailand. In the closing session, I saw a calligraphy on the slideshow, “You have seen the path. Do not fear anymore.” I was deeply moved to tears, and I didn’t know why. Slowly I recognized that I had a fear that I wouldn’t be able to see Thay again. That calligraphy was like encouraging words from Thay, comforting me that it’s not important to see Thay personally. It’s more important to be able to see the path.</p>
<h2>The Path of Compassion</h2>
<p>I received a lineage name, Chân Trời Đạo Bi, which means True Sky over the Path of Compassion. It reminds me that my practice is to see the Path of Compassion. “The Path of Compassion” is one of my favorite chapters in the “Old Path White Clouds” that I have read over and over. It tells the story when Siddhartha and Yasodhara were social workers, and they did not know how to overcome the sadness and grief in their hearts. Yasodhara was overwhelmed by grief when a young child she had tended to for more than a week had just died. Siddharta tried to console her but he was not yet able to help her to overcome the grief because he had not yet seen found the path. Only after Siddharta became the Buddha, was he able to discover the path of compassion and understanding and show this path to others.</p>
<p>I feel very fortunate that Thay has helped me to see this path. I had a lot of wounds as a social worker before I ordained, and I see that I am still on the path of healing my wounds. Knowing that I am on the path brings me a lot of happiness. The painful feelings of the wounds come up from time to time, but I have learned how to be with my wounds, and to understand my wounds. Thay always teaches us that understanding suffering is the way to generate compassion. This path has helped me to grow in my understanding of life. Thanks to being able to see the path, I see my wounds as ingredients to grow compassion. When compassion arises, I do not have to fear. This is like a mantra or a guided meditation for myself. “Breathing in, you have seen the path. Breathing out, do not fear anymore”.</p>
<p>This mantra has helped me overcome my regret of not being able to see Thay anymore, to embrace the fear and to remind myself that my practice is to be able to see the path. I regret that I had not decided to become a monk a little bit earlier and gone to Plum Village, then I would have had a chance to be with Thay, and to receive his advice and guidance directly. I was able to come to Plum Village in 2015, when Thay was no longer able to speak. Sometimes I have dreams of talking with Thay, and it makes me very happy.</p>
<p>I feel grateful that I have been born in this spiritual life as a disciple of Thay. I have learned a lot from Thay even though Thay is no longer able to teach verbally. Thay continues teaching in the non-verbal way. When Thay joined the walking meditation in his wheelchair, Thay would pick up a leaf and with a playful gesture, Thay made everyone laugh. Thay doesn’t need to teach verbally to make people feel happy. Just by pointing at the sky, trees, flowers, and the wonders of life, Thay can help people to generate joy and happiness. Sometimes when we stopped during the walking meditation, Thay would pat or hug his disciples, and I felt as if Thay was patting and hugging me and everybody as well.</p>
<!-- Walking meditation with Thay in Lower Hamlet -->
<h2>Seeing Thay and the Path with the Eyes of Signlessness</h2>
<p>One time, I saw Thay in his wheelchair when we were practicing walking meditation in Lower Hamlet. I saw Thay from the other shore of a lotus pond, and a branch blocked my view of Thay. I moved to the left and to the right, trying to see Thay. I asked myself, “Where is Thay?” Then I realized that I was still caught in Thay’s form. I was looking for Thay in his form, and I had not been able to see Thay with the eyes of signlessness.</p>
<p>I feel fortunate to be able to read letters from Thay. In one of the letters Thay says, “Thay and his disciples feel every day that they have the Buddha practicing sitting meditation, eating meditation, and walking meditation with them. For us Buddha is not a distant image from the past but a living reality, which we can see with the insight of signlessness.” Sometimes I feel that Thay practices sitting, eating, and walking meditation with us even though Thay is not in Plum Village. Whenever I come back to my breathing, I feel that Thay and the Buddha are very close to me. If I am not aware of my breathing, Thay is far away from me.</p>
<p>From time to time, I ask myself “Have I really seen the path?” This koan always accompanies me. I don’t know if I have really seen the path. I still have a lot of fear and sorrow, and a part of me says that it is difficult to really feel that I do not have to fear. The practice of listening to the sound of the bell has helped me a lot. When I recite the gatha “Listening to the bell, I feel my afflictions begin to dissolve”, I see that my fear and sorrow slowly begin to dissolve, day by day.</p>
<h2>The European Wake Up CTC</h2>
<p>When some brothers and sisters were organizing the Wake Up Ambassadors Retreat in Plum Village for the first time in 2018, we established the European Wake Up CTC. We call it 'Oomph', because it sounds more fun! Some people felt that CTC sounds too formal, and they didn’t want to have more meetings when they joined the CTC. We agreed that we wanted to establish the CTC as a way for us to get nourishment and joy. Since then we have monthly Zoom Online Gatherings. Right now Annica Bauer, Verena Böttcher, Toos Vergote, Arlind Reuter, Fransisco Vogel, Jan-Jitze Hees, Sr. Tao Nghiem, Sr. Xuong Nghiem, Sr. Loc Uyen, Br. Duc Niem, and myself serve in Oomph.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Oomph monthly online gatherings, the Wake Up International coordinator at that time, Hong-An Tran Tien joined us. Since the end of 2019, we formed the Wake Up International Coordination Team with Jazz (Wake Up Australasia), Lewis (Wake Up North America), and Annica (Wake Up Europe).</p>
<p>Once every three months, we have an online gathering with the Wake Up Ambassadors in Europe. Every month, we continue to deepen our connection and friendship. Usually we have the online gathering on Thursday or Sunday evenings, which are lazy evenings in Plum Village after the Days of Mindfulness. Sometimes I feel tired but when I join the online gathering, I always feel as if I am coming back to the house and gathering with the family in the living room, and asking, “How is everybody doing?” or “How was your day?” The lay members share their difficulties, both personal and in their Wake Up Sanghas, and the monastic members also share their difficulties, so we create mutual support and deepen our brotherhood and sisterhood. Sometimes we also have fun together, play online games, sing, and dance!</p>
<!-- Happy Wake Up Ambassadors Change The World -->
<p>We came up with what Oomph stands for: Organism for Optimising Many People’s Happiness. Oomph is not an organization, it is an organism. When the Wake Up Ambassadors have a place of refuge, they are able to optimise their own happiness. When the Wake Up Ambassadors are happy, they are able to help other people in their Sangha and optimise other people’s happiness. Happy Wake Up Ambassadors can help to optimise many people’s happiness and thus help change the world.</p>
<!-- Calligraphy by Thay Phap Huu -->
<h2>Wake Up Earth Holder</h2>
<p>In May 2020, we had the Wake Up Online Retreat in Plum Village. One of the main concerns of young people now is protecting the environment and and it was one of the main topics we addressed with the 250 young people who joined the retreat. During the retreat, some brothers and sisters felt the need to establish an Earth Holder Sangha in Europe. At the end of the retreat, we announced that we would have a monthly online Earth Holder gathering with young people. Since then, Br. Duc Niem, Sr. Tao Nghiem, Sr. Loc Uyen, Sr. Giac Hoa, Sr. Khuong Dinh, Simona Coayla-Duba, Aoise, Gijs, Alex, myself, and other sisters and brothers have joined the core group. Some young people from different continents like Europe, the Americas, and Asia also join the online gathering every month. We share joys and tears around the topic of Mother Earth. We hold Mother Earth deeply in our hearts, and find ways to support one another.</p>
<h2>Building Wake Up is to build brotherhood and sisterhood</h2>
<p>My sisters and brothers who have been involved in the Wake Up movement keep reminding each other that whatever we do in Plum Village or the wider community, we are doing in order to build brotherhood and sisterhood. One time, Sr. Loc Uyen who now serves in Oomph and Wake Up Earth Holder CTC said that we need to come together as brothers and sisters in the CTC then everything else will unfold well. When the young people see that we can optimise our own happiness, they will be inspired to learn and put into practice Plum Village teachings in order to optimise their own happiness.</p>
<p>I’ve been involved in Wake Up as I’m still under 35 years old. Yet many of monastics and lay friends who are involved in Wake Up are above 35 years old, but they are still young! They have a youthful energy and I really learn a lot from them. They still have a big heart to be with young people. Brother Thien Y offered a calligraphy to me “The path of compassion is endless, but together it’s a lot of fun!”</p>
<p>In the “Praising the Buddha Chant”, I very much like this sentence, ”May the Sangha practice diligently, showing love and concern for one and all. Just as for our very own family…” It always moves me as it reflects my deep aspiration to practice in such a way to show love and concern for young people, the human family, and all beings. It’s a lot of fun to practice with young people and to show others that when we practice we don’t have to be too serious, that it can be fun!</p>

<h2>Wake Up is a Precious Gem of the Plum Village Tradition</h2>
<p>In my Wake Up online Dharma sharing family during the Rains Retreat 2021, I invited everybody to share the most precious gem of our tradition to them. It could be a discourse that we learnt in this retreat, or a practice that is the most important to them. After everybody shared, I shared that Dharma sharing is the most precious gem of our tradition to me. I can learn a lot from what they shared during the three months, how they applied the teachings, and the living insights born from experiences shared in the family. Dharma sharing and eating meals in family are my favorite practices in our tradition. The Plum Village tradition attracts many young people because Thay and the Sangha have been able to renew Buddhism in a way that is more relevant to young people, and establish Wake Up as a Dharma door for young people. The Wake Up Dharma door is truly a precious gem of the Plum Village tradition.</p>

<h2>Thay and the Buddha Have Shown Us the Path</h2>
<p>One of my favorite parts in “Old Path White Clouds” always helps me to nourish my beginner’s mind. This chapter talks about Venerable Ananda who had not yet attained his spiritual goal of enlightenment when the Buddha was dying. Venerable Ananda was weeping and the Buddha tried to comfort Ananda. He said, “Don’t be so sad, Ananda. The Tathagata has reminded you that all dharmas are impermanent. With birth, there is death; with arising, there is dissolving; with coming together, there is separation. How can there be birth without death? How can there be arising without dissolving? How can there be coming together without separation? Ananda, you have cared for me with all your heart for many years. You have devoted all your efforts to helping me and I am most grateful to you. Your merit is great, Ananda, but you can go even farther. If you make just a little more effort, you can overcome birth and death. You can attain freedom and transcend every sorrow. I know you can do that, and that is what would make me the most happy.”</p>
<p>Reading this part always gives me faith that we can be enlightened without the presence of The Awakened One. Ananda was able to really see the path and attain his spiritual goal after the Buddha passed into Nirvana. It gives me faith and hope that we can attain freedom and transcend every sorrow after Thay continues from his form. I see that Thay’s presence in Vietnam now is giving us an opportunity to make a little more effort to overcome birth and death, like the Buddha’s advice to Ananda. Thay knows we can do that, and that is what would make Thay most happy.</p>
<p>Thay has shown the path to me and many people. Thay is a teacher who has shown us how to understand and to love. My deep aspiration is to continue to walk on this path and to help other people see this path. I know this is what would make Thay most happy.</p>

            <div class="author">Brother Chân Trời Đạo Quang</div>
            <p>During the Rains’ Retreat 2021, my brothers would often see me mixing a grayish dust with water in an old pot and then pouring the mixture into a small blue bucket. EventuallyFinally, I would return to the monastic residence with something in my hands, much to their curiosity. I did this every day for the 90-days of the Rains’ Retreat.</p>
<h2>My mission</h2>
<p>I was pouring cement Buddhas everyday during the 90-days Rains’ Retreat. I set out to make 90 Buddhas, one on each day of the retreat and to give them to our lay friends as a gift at the end of it. I decided to do this because I love Buddha statues. I just have fun with the mud and a mold I made to cast the Buddhas. When I take a Buddha out of the mold, I have a very happy feeling. It’s a bit like becoming a father. I am very focused on the job and my mind comes to rest. At the end of each day I hold a Buddha in my hands and I take it back to the residence feeling very satisfied. I really enjoy it.</p>
<h2>Giving away Buddhas</h2>
<p>I decided to give the Buddhas away as whenever I see a Buddha, I calm down and start smiling. Automatically! I have also observed that many other people have a similar experience. So, the idea to make Buddhas and to give them away was born in me. I want more people to see Buddhas and feel happy. In these difficult times with contact restrictions and mask requirements, this action can help to put a smile on people's faces. Actually, I would love to have one for everyone. To give each person a Buddha to be able to see that they are happy for a moment. I am sure if there were more Buddha statues in the world, more people would feel happy and behave more peacefully. I have set out to make 100,000 Buddha statues. Let's see if I can do it in this life. In any case, it cannot be achieved with my current resources, but let’s see what happens, maybe there will be a solution!</p>
<h2>Would you like a Buddha statue from Brother Dao Quang?</h2>
<p>Is it a good idea to put his email address in?</p>
<p><em>Anyone can ask me, monastics and lay friends. At the moment my capacity is limited to one figure a day because I have only one mold. You don't need to give me anything. No donation is required. Please give the Buddha a nice home or give it away as a present to a loved one. They are weather- and frost- proof. If you don't like the color, you can also paint it. If you like, you can send me a photo of it. You can reach me at daoquang@plumvillage.org</em></p>

            <div class="author">Brother Chân Trời Đức Hiền</div>
            <p>Beep, beep, beep, it’s 5:00 AM!</p>
<p>I woke up this morning, cradled by the song of both rain and wind, which have been playing for the last few hours relieving the trees from their last autumn leaves.</p>
<p>I love the feeling of being instantly connected to the vitality of the elements as soon as I open my eyes. I smile…</p>
<p>My body feels rather painful. I have a very bad cold and have been coughing for a few weeks already. Medical diagnosis reveals that bacteria have found their way into my lungs. The antibiotic treatment gives me headaches and flu-like symptoms, especially at night. It is due to the toxins released by the bacteria when they are eliminated. I know these sensations very well because I have been there before, especially with Lyme disease. I am very tempted to stay in bed. I can see a part of me that wants to rebel against suffering, as if I could strike against life itself! I smile…</p>
<p>Experience also tells me that if I surrender to that resistance, I run the risk of extracting myself from the stream of life, to start dwelling in drowsiness and open the door to complaining. I am aware that this door inside me is not totally closed and that it is not the right time to venture that way.</p>
<p>So I connect again to the song of the rain, and especially to my brother’s presence in the room, who is slowly awakening from sleep.  I know this morning routine perfectly and it is reassuring. It projects me into a comforting and familiar space. His gestures are very gentle, and I fully benefit from the energy of mindfulness he manifests in the way he moves through the room.</p>
<p>While the water boils in the kettle, I settle into my breathing to carefully contemplate the pain that holds my head in a vice. Being an observer allows me to put this gruelling sensation into some kind of perspective. I then feel like an explorer who, without bias, discovers what simply is, curious to taste the experience that is manifesting. I clearly see that I am not locked inside this sensation, that it is totally limited in space, and that everything around it breathes like a vast living ocean. I smile…</p>
<p>In the same way, I connect to the impermanence of all things, knowing by experience that this pain will eventually end. My absolute trust in the capacity of life to evolve and transform, allows me to ease considerably out of the influence of the pain that has a hold over my whole brain; an invitation for me, to once again, cultivate patience - a quality which has never been one of my strong points.</p>
<p>I also intensify my awareness of the tricks of the mind, which is trying to weave a narrative of complaints, a victim strategy to sublimate a deep feeling of powerlessness. Instead, I take root in the soil of my vulnerability, where the most genuine seeds flourish. I smile…</p>
<p>Illuminated by candles, we drink tea. The soft warmth of the cup between my two hands spreads throughout my whole body. I become available again, well established in the present moment and I taste the quality of this inner silence. I still perceive the pain but my level of reactivity towards it has lessened. I am well on the way to reclaiming my inner freedom. I smile…</p>
<p>Then I go out for a fifteen-minute walk before going to the meditation hall. Immediately, the cool air strikes me and I let the deliciously humid morning breeze caress my face. A moment of grace! I love feeling so small amidst immensity, humbly walking as if carried by Mother Earth. Then I feel myself <em>being</em> beyond the apparent limits of this body and mind. What seemed only a moment ago so very narrowly constrained by physical pain, appears now to be but a temporary undulation on the fabric of the universe. I smile…</p>
<p>what's this</p>
<p>Then I surrender a little more to what appears to me very concretely as the dimension of non-self, of bigger than self. I let myself be penetrated by this vastness which allows me to breathe spaciously.  Relaxed and present in each of my steps, I realize anew that I have the freedom to choose my way of viewing this path of incarnation. Either I remain conditioned to form, irremediably identified with this manifestation of a <em>self</em> , or I take refuge in what is larger, let myself <em>be</em> and smile to the mystery of existence. Then the spontaneous dynamic of <em>I am</em> releases itself without control or limitations, and generates a multitude of creative momentums.</p>
<p>I was caught in the net of separation, identification and need for recognition for so many years, that this ultimate discernment propels me instantly into joy. Living over and over every event as an opportunity to celebrate life is pure magic. An owl hoots on my right side, another one answers from the depths of darkness. I smile…</p>
<p>I hear the sound of the Great Bell, and the chanting of the brother in the distance, inviting us to the meditation hall, like a call in the night, encouraging all the lost souls to unify in prayer. With tenderness, I notice all the moving shadows slowly gathering towards this place of spiritual communion. I feel carried by a siblinghood that shares the same aspiration: cultivating mindfulness energy to embrace all that is, without discrimination, with understanding and love. I smile…</p>
<p>I reach the old stone barn which has been marvelously transformed into a meditation hall by the brothers who have tread this path before us. I stop for a moment to contemplate the stained glass, illuminated by a few candles from the inside. I enter the hall gently and bow in front of the altar. Some of the brothers are already sitting on their cushions. The quiet atmosphere of dedication instantly immerses me in a sacred dimension.</p>
<p>In turn, I sit on my cushion, delicately adjusting my posture. I spontaneously settle into my breath and let a big smile of contentment arise on my face. I feel so supported by this diligent practice energy. I smile…</p>
<p>Well! The headache is still there! What a powerful mindfulness bell! No doubt, it brings me back to my body. My mind was already gone, exploring thousands of territories. Thank you…</p>
<p>A sudden thought: How many of us on this planet are suffering at this very moment (humans, animals, plants, minerals)? A dizzying contemplation which clutches my heart, and reveals the meaning and the need for our commitment. I take total refuge in the dimension of inter-being. I am fully aware that this practice of welcoming everything that is, without condition, without rejecting anything from the experience, instantly benefits all beings.  I take root in this equanimity to connect better to the world.  My true power dwells inside me, and it is my responsibility to take care of it like a gardener, but also like a guardian. I take the vow to cultivate appropriate attention at all times, so that I can discern what is good for me, for all beings and for Mother Earth. I commit to taking care of my thoughts, words and actions, knowing they are energetic imprints that impact the present and will be transmitted to future generations. I smile…</p>
<p>Then, I feel propelled into the past, by the contact with my genetic ancestors. Many of them have been submerged by the waves of suffering that washed over their hearts. I see the faces of my father and my maternal grandfather who weren’t able to resist their suicidal urges after my mother died in an accident.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I had the inner experience of my father’s suicide, moment by moment.</p>
<p>An intensely realistic sensory experience, out of time and space. Fortunately, that morning I was feeling deeply peaceful and rooted.</p>
<p><em>“I am one with my dad, swallowed by that storm of suffering, loaded with feelings of loss, absence and despair.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel his powerlessness and his call to put an end to his unbearable emotional torture. Nothing can appease him, he can only resort to ultimate relief; it is the only choice he sees.</em></p>
<p><em>I feel the abyss of sadness that leads him to grab his weapon, with calm and determination, and apply it to his temple.</em></p>
<p><em>I can also feel the metal of the gun on my skin, cold as ice.”</em></p>
<p>For him, there was no other way. For me it is different. I am immensely fortunate to have discovered the miracle of mindfulness. I smile…</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, a rush of gratitude washes over me, like a rising tide! A wave of soft and gentle warmth runs through my body. I become acutely aware of how blessed I am to be sitting in meditation in this enveloping matrix of stone, built by our mason ancestors, in the company of diligent practitioners, and to have the capacity to greet what manifests in me. I rely on the collective energy of practice as I offer my contemplation to all beings. I receive and give at the very same time. I give my support and am supported by the power of our commitment to face the reality of what appears in every second. I connect to the determination of each of my brothers and sisters to walk in truth on the path of liberation.</p>
<p>My heart sings. Thank you Thay, thank you to the past, present and future generations for cultivating and transmitting beauty, wisdom, discipline and the qualities inherent to the path of awakening. I smile…</p>
<p>The bell is invited. I stretch, rub my knees tenderly, and delicately open my eyes. The headache is almost gone. Wonderful! We prepare to touch the earth. The text invites us to contemplate <em>No Birth and No Death</em>. I am touched by this synchronicity with the universe, which always offers me what I need. It is up to me to develop my availability and my capacity to fully receive what is offered. I smile…</p>
<p>Touching the Earth, I honestly assess my relationship to illness, aging and death. Trusting my breath, I anchor my body and observe my physical sensations and feelings. <em>”There is a lot of space, my breathing is spacious.</em></p>
<p><em>A light quivering breeze caresses my cells; an intense perception of peace and emptiness conveys absolute abundance.</em></p>
<p><em>A creative silence breathing the spark of life forever.”</em></p>
<p>A dance of wavicles (wave-particles), without goal and without form, just an elusive movement. There, free from the grip of time and space, all fears dissolve. In the firmament of the original Love all manifestation is pure Joy. I smile…</p>
<p>I exit the meditation hall; the horizon quietly dons its morning blue, highlighted with a light orange hue. Despite the rain, the sun is about to pierce the thick layer of clouds. A rainbow, maybe? I smile…</p>

            <h1 id="i-have-a-dream" class="chapter">I Have a Dream</h1>
            <div class="author">Brother Chân Trời Đức Niệm</div>
            <p><em>This writing is dedicated to and inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his spiritual brother and friend, our beloved teacher Thay.</em></p>
<p>This Summer, while in quarantine in Turtle Lodge, after a home visit, there was a night when I could not sleep. I woke up in the middle of the night, gripped by fear and worry. I practiced deep belly breathing and tried to embrace my fear tenderly. In the previous days I had been reading some articles about the climate crisis.</p>
<p>The new IPCC report, which had just come out, says unequivocally that we need to keep the average global temperature increase below 1.5 °C to avoid catastrophic climate consequences. At our current rate of emissions, in only six or seven years we will have used up the global carbon budget. Scientists have calculated this: If we emit more emissions and use up this carbon budget, the chances of reaching certain tipping points and thus accelerating further climate heating beyond human control are very high. Once we reach a tipping point we cannot go back and ‘fix’ it. So we should stay within the 1.5 °C target.</p>
<p>We can understand the current situation better with this metaphor: Spaceship Earth is like a big container ship that is heading full speed towards a hidden iceberg. However, the surface of the vast ocean is rather calm - only if we look deeply, will we see the iceberg. If we continue like we are now, we will hit the iceberg and sink. Because the ship is very large, it needs some time to change course. But if we turn the ship’s driving wheel too sharply and abruptly, then the ship might sink as well (<em>due to social collapse and unrest</em>). This means there remains only a small, narrow window of time and path in which the ship can change course.</p>
<p>While I was lying wide awake in the middle of the night, and breathing deeply, a voice in me was saying: “<em>This is not acceptable, we cannot continue like this anymore. We need to do something now</em>.” I sat up and started to write down some ideas and reflections that have been cooking in me for a while. When I finally did bring pen to paper what was in my heart and store consciousness, I felt that my heart was much lighter and more at peace. My experience is that allowing myself to cultivate a vision and dreams has helped me to see a path forward and gives me hope, energy and inspiration. In this article I would like to share with you some of these dreams and reflections and some ways in which we are living this dream already. I hope that it inspires and nourishes you as well.</p>
<p><em>I have a dream. I have a dream that one day people of all different religious, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds, of different ages, colours and genders will come together and unite. That we will join hands and join forces because we see and feel that there is something more important and precious than our individual and national interests that unites us all: peace, justice, siblinghood, and the future of our beautiful blue planet.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a dream that the seeds of compassion and awakening sown by the Buddha, Thay, and our spiritual ancestors, will continue to sprout and soon fully blossom like jeweled lotus flowers in the hearts of millions of people and that the vision and dream of Thay will be realized: A collective global awakening. Thay reminds us, “We have to wake up together. And if we wake up together, then we have a chance.”</em></p>
<p><em>I have a dream that mother Earth will again be clothed in her beautiful green mantle as humans plant billions of trees, restoring the abundance and the wonders of life. Many people around the world have this aspiration and are already helping deserts to become oases of green, lush trees, sustainable for farming again.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a dream that on billions of rooftops, town halls, churches, and meditation halls around the globe glimmering solar panels will radiate and spread the warmth and light of Father Sun into our homes, along with wind turbines on the green land and the blue sea, totally replacing the use of fossil fuels.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a dream that everywhere in the world small ‘Happy Farms’ and other kinds of intentional communities will sprout, harvesting not only delicious and fresh vegetables, but also the fruits of the practice, bringing forth the happiness and togetherness of people working and living in communities.</em></p>
<p>We can celebrate the fact that in Plum Village we have been able to realize many aspects of this dream in the past 40 years already: Thay has helped his brother, Martin Luther King Jr. to make their dream of the “Beloved Community” a living reality. Thay has built a beautiful, diverse, and vibrant international community where people from various cultural and religious backgrounds have found their spiritual home and begun to explore new ways of living together. We have been practicing to be vegan since 2007 and have planted many trees. During the Rain’s Retreat we planted more than two hundred trees in a single day in New Hamlet – working and planting trees together as a fourfold Sangha has brought a lot of joy, nourishment and fulfillment to me. In Deer Park Monastery we have drawn power from solar panels since the early 2000s and in Upper Hamlet we will also install solar panels soon. Over many years volunteers and hundreds of children in the Summer Retreats have been nourished by our Happy Farms, getting in touch with nature and harvesting red tomatoes, golden corn, and black berries with their own hands. One of Plum Village’s most important contributions is that we show the world that it is possible to live a happy and fulfilled life without consuming much, without lots of money or comforts. Seeing the joy, love and harmony among our siblings helps many people to wake up to the reality that another way of life is possible. This gives people hope, strength and inspiration to change their lives and society.</p>
<p>I see that I am able to live my dream of building a beloved community here every day. Being here gives me the chance to learn and deepen my experiences in community building: In sangha meetings I learn more about the art of reaching a collective decision and insight, how to communicate, to contribute and let go of ideas. I have a chance to bring people together and to help organize activities, e.g. the activist retreat, workshops or Dharma sharings about Mother Earth. It was wonderful to witness the deep connections, sincere dedication and joy of the retreatants and monastics from different centers during the “Action from the Heart” online retreat. We have started a Wake Up Earth Holder Sangha, where we watch Thay’s talks about the environment and practice Dharma sharing. Building siblinghood, playing together and at the same time engaging with the topics and increasing our collective awareness gives me a lot of nourishment and joy.</p>
<p>One way I am watering the seeds of insight is by reading books by climate leaders and thinkers like Joanna Macy, Naomi Klein and Thay. In his new book “<em>Zen and the Art of Saving the Planet”</em>, Thay shares about the importance of community building and global ethics. I also keep my awareness alive by listening to the podcast “Outrage + Optimism” by Christiana Figueres, a student of Thay and the architect of the Paris Climate Agreement. It is very interesting, joyful and inspiring to hear from many people around the world, and helps me feel more connected with the global climate movement that demands an end to fossil fuels.</p>
<p>For centuries our economies have been running on fossil fuels. The oil, gas, and coal industries are so deeply linked with the political and economic system that it is very difficult to untie this knot of greed, profit-seeking and lobbyism. I believe that only intense public pressure and a broad diverse, yet unified movement will be powerful enough to end the use of fossil fuels in time and to realize a swift and fair transition of our system. Thay has been very clear and outspoken about these roots of the environmental crisis for a long time now. Addressing the leaders at COP 2009 in Copenhagen he said, “We need to subsidise renewable energies and heavily tax fossil fuels. It is possible to have 100% renewable energy by 2030.” What would Thay say now in 2022 to world leaders and activists, if he were able to speak out?</p>
<p>A question that comes up here is: How can we spread the harmony, experiences and wisdom of our sangha building to other communities, organizations, and faith groups? What can we do to help the beloved community manifest not only in one tradition, but in many, and – more importantly – across traditions? Every day I try to keep this koan alive in my heart, “Given that we  only have a few more years left to start changing the course of spaceship Earth, what can we do to help the collective global awakening manifest a little bit more quickly and widely?”</p>
<p>Many of us are aware that the climate crisis is an important challenge we face. Has this awareness - that the actions or non-actions of the next few years will very likely determine the fate of humanity - penetrated deeply into our consciousness yet? I think many of us – including me – do not feel the urgency and pain of this crisis deeply every day. It can be quite overwhelming. I feel that <em>manas</em><span class="note"><em>manas</em> is an aspect of our consciousness that seeks pleasure and avoids pain.</span> wants to avoid suffering in the present moment. That is why our mind tells us that the crisis is not <em>that</em> urgent and we still have enough time, or helps us find ways to avoid the topic altogether <em>(psychological barriers like cognitive dissonance, distance, denial, doomism).</em> We run the risk of fooling ourselves, individually and collectively. Insights and awakening are impermanent, so we need to put some effort into keeping this awareness alive every day and to help more and more people to wake up. I have the hope that we can have regular sessions of “heart-storming” <em>(Thay used this term in a Dharma talk on March 1st 2003),</em> to share about our dreams and aspirations and to look deeply as a Sangha into what we can do to contribute locally and globally.</p>
<p><em>I have a dream that one day many different spiritual and faith traditions, humanitarian groups and NGOs will come together to co-create and follow a code of Global Ethics similar to the Five Mindfulness Trainings. I am convinced that this can serve as a connecting element between different groups and engaged people, and as a foundation, and inspiration for a new movement.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a dream that many different climate justice, science, and spiritual leaders and other organisations from around the globe will come together to form the most diverse, colorful and biggest non-violent movement in history, uniting behind one goal: to stay below 1.5° C by ending the era of fossil fuel consumption  and creating a just, inclusive, peaceful, and regenerative world society on a green and healthy planet.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a dream that bells of mindfulness, of awakening, climate justice and peace will sound everywhere in the world, from every hill top, in every town, from countless temples and churches, and in many people’s hearts.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a dream that people of different faiths in many villages and cities around the world will come together to listen to these bells of mindfulness, stopping to pray, practice, and recite the global ethics trainings together, and listen deeply to each other. Listening to each other’s suffering, joy, and insights into what we can contribute to transform this crisis, and then acting together locally to make it happen.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a dream that more and more people every day will realize that this planet Earth</em> is <em>the Kingdom of God,</em> is <em>the Pure Land,</em> is <em>a most precious jewel of the cosmos, and that they fall in love deeply with Mother Earth and find true peace in their hearts.</em></p>
<p>We can celebrate the fact that in Plum Village we have been able to contribute to this dream in the past 40 years. Thay and the Sangha have transmitted the Five Mindfulness Trainings to hundreds of thousands of practitioners worldwide. The Five Mindfulness Trainings are a powerful and timely Buddhist contribution to a global ethic. Thay has also helped to formulate the UNESCO Manifesto 2000 that was signed by 70 million people.</p>
<p>I saw Thay for the first time 20 years ago in Germany. He shared about the Kingdom of God being available in the here and the now. Having been raised Christian, I was touched very deeply by his teaching and especially by his way of being. This was a real eye-opener as I realized that it was indeed possible to touch the Kingdom of God in this life and on this beautiful planet. Thay’s shining example of <em>being</em> peace is an immense contribution to the world.</p>
<p>I see that I am able to live this dream here every day. We are so lucky that we can continue Thay’s way and dream. Every day I go for mindful walks in the forest and hills surrounding Upper Hamlet, getting in touch with the beauty and miracles of Mother Earth. After breakfast I walk to Thenac through the old path at the edge of the hill overlooking the golden vineyards, the deer forest and a little blue lake, enjoying the magical morning mist and glorious sunrise. The many shades of red, pink and orange are reflected in the clouds in the wide sky and are so beautiful. This nourishes and refreshes my body and soul deeply. I also learn more ways to take better care of the fear and pain inside that is partly related to some individual and collective trauma. I practice to take time to contemplate it and not to run away. I notice that by doing this more space, peace and acceptance are slowly growing in me.</p>
<p><em>I have a dream that one day the children and young people of this planet can go out and play freely together in the green parks and car-free alleys of the cities and villages, without fear or worries about the future, without many of them feeling the heavy burden of eco-anxiety and depression on their shoulders.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a dream that one day our nephews and nieces and all children of the world will be able to sit down together at the table of siblinghood in peace and freedom, looking towards a bright future on a beautiful, green, healthy planet.</em></p>
<p><em>I have a dream today. I have a dream that we as a sangha, along with many other spiritual, climate activist and other groups, will sit together as one global beloved community on the hill of the 21st century and look back on the narrow winding road up the steep mountain of challenges and say, “It is good, we have managed to climb the mountain together and fight and unite for a inclusive, peaceful, and regenerative 1.5 °C world and we have been able to create it with harmony, love, and siblinghood.”</em></p>
<p>This is our hope and prayer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Let the bells of freedom, mindfulness, peace, and awakening ring in every being across the universe.</em><br/>
<em>Let the bells of awakening, compassion, and climate justice ring from every temple, church, mosque and synagogue, because people of faith have the power to wake people up.</em><br/>
<em>Let the bells of awakening, strength and wisdom ring in the minds and hearts of the young generations, because they feel the urgency keenly and have the most determination, imagination and fierceness to stand up for a green, just, and regenerative world.</em><br/>
<em>Let the bells of awakening, freedom, and love ring in the hearts of every being so that the symphonic harmony, strength and beauty of the bells touch their hearts deeply and a collective global awakening will manifest widely and powerfully at last.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

            <h1 id="happiness-where-are-you" class="chapter">Happiness, Where Are You?</h1>
            <div class="author">Brother Chân Trời Ruộng Đức</div>
            <p>Time passes by so quickly. Entering the third year of life as a novice, looking again at my bodhichitta, I ask myself, why am I here? Am I waking up a little bit more everyday? In the past I gave food, medicine, clothes, and provided accommodation for people who were in need. My thinking was that they would feel happy and satisfied once they had received help, but in fact the situation was not like that, what I offered only helped them in part. I saw that after they had received material support, they were still not happy and continued to wait for assistance, so we had to continue to look for a way to help them. At that time I didn't know how to practice and so I created a burden for myself. When l saw that they were unhappy, I also became unhappy. I started to ask myself, why is it like this?</p>
<p>After practicing in Plum Village, I can see that my joy and happiness are increasing a little bit more each day. I am learning to listen to the voice in myself more, and learning to understand myself. I have an aspiration to take care of my inner garden and to discover more about my life.</p>
<p>At this time last year, my father passed away and I felt that my mother and siblings needed my presence and support, so I travelled back home to Malaysia to visit them. I am very grateful to the Sangha for giving me this opportunity. During my home visit, I could feel that the outside environment was tempting me but also that people’s lives were full of pressures and challenges. After a few weeks of staying outside of the monastery, I suddenly had a feeling of missing the sangha. Even though I practiced morning and evening sitting meditation, and walking meditation everyday, it was still easy for me to get carried away by the energy that was surrounding me. Because of this, I had to keep reminding myself again and again to come back to myself. I realized that to practice together with the sangha is easier than to practice alone and that it is so crucial to get nourished by the sangha’s collective energy, to take refuge in the sangha. The sangha and its practice can help me purify my body and mind every day. No matter how difficult and challenging life is, the sangha is always there to support me.</p>
<p>A few months ago, l moved to Son Ha Temple (near Upper Hamlet) to join the sangha there. In the beginning, living together with the sangha was not easy for me, especially when I did not know how to take care of myself. But thanks to the guidance and support of my mentors Br. Nguyen Tinh and Br. Phap Ao, I have been learning ways to take care of my suffering, and I don’t know where I would be without them.</p>
<p>The climate in Son Ha is quite humid and cold compared to the Upper Hamlet. When winter came, the temperature began to decline and the room became very cold, especially because my mentor never uses the heater and l wish to follow his way of living.</p>
<p>However, thanks to his example and his way of training, my body began to accept the environment slowly. My mentor knows that l am afraid of the cold. Thanks to his kindness, I was able to change to a thicker quilt and the problem of keeping warm when sleeping was solved. I can now sleep peacefully at night. Sometimes I would think to myself: right this moment, there are many people, especially children, who are living in abject poverty, who do not have enough clothes for the winter. I am very lucky to have enough clothes to wear and to continue to practice.</p>
<p>Staying in the sangha, I have many chances to practice, like inviting the great temple bell, doing the morning chant, leading walking meditation, and offering guided sitting meditation. I know I am a shy person, but thanks to these opportunities, I am slowly able to overcome my shyness. This brings me a lot of courage in the practice.</p>
<p>Working in the greenhouse has been the most wonderful gift for me during this year's Rain’s Retreat. I want to share with you the process of enjoying the work with my mentors in the greenhouse. At first I thought that to work in the greenhouse is to offer vegetables to the sangha, but actually this is not the main purpose.</p>
<p>When we started working, my mentor Br. Phap Ao started to cut the grass with a trimmer, and Br. Nguyen Tinh and I used tools to remove the weeds together. We began to loosen the soil and create rectangular beds. We watered the soil and left it to be nourished by the water. Dry soil cannot absorb water easily, so it took a long time for water to soak in. Br. Phap Ao just smiled and said to me, &quot;You just keep watering it everyday.” Oh… It sounded like he wanted to tell me something, but what?</p>
<p>After working in the greenhouse for just two days, I had already released a lot of the stress and tension in my body and mind. After a few days of watering, we used chicken manure to fertilize the soil and now the soil could absorb the water easily.</p>
<p>My mentors started sowing seeds and told me to keep watering them every day. After a few days of taking care, I saw the seeds begin to sprout. A few days later, seedlings started to grow. My mentors transferred some seedlings to another place, so they had enough space to grow.</p>
<p>During one afternoon of mindful service, while I was watering the seedlings wholeheartedly, I suddenly realized that the seedlings were smiling at me. Oh… so wonderful! It was the first time I could see this clearly. For me this was a very precious moment, and this is also what my mentors wanted to tell me.</p>
<p>When the seedlings began to grow into vegetables, the weeds also gradually grew. I just kept watering the vegetables and didn’t take care of the weeds. One morning when I was enjoying a cup of tea with my mentor, who knew that I didn't take care of the weeds, he smiled and said to me, &quot;You only know how to water the vegetables.” After that I realized that as I’m watering the vegetables, at the same time, I have to take care of the weeds. One afternoon when l was removing the weeds with my mentor Br. Nguyen Tinh, I found that I could not uproot all of the weeds because the vegetables did not have strong enough roots. I could only trim the weeds above ground. He looked at me, smiled, and said that maybe you need to wait for the vegetables to be strong enough before you can uproot the weeds. I listened and I had to wait patiently for the vegetables to grow stronger.</p>
<p>Autumn was coming to an end. I saw that the arugula (rocket) was about to die, so I took out the arugula plants together with the weeds. I noticed that the stems of the vegetables and the roots of the weeds crossed over one another in many places. I separated them all from each other and replanted the arugula, and after a few days, new leaves started to grow. I was so happy! I looked at the arugula and asked myself, can I do the same thing with my suffering?</p>
<p>One afternoon when I was harvesting vegetables, my mentor Br. Phap Ao told me that starting from today, I would have to come here to catch slugs every early morning and evening. The holes in the vegetables were the traces left by the slugs after they enjoyed the leaves. After I received my mentor’s message, a strong curiosity arose in my heart. Is there any relationship between the slugs and my life? Starting from that day, almost every morning and evening I stepped into the greenhouse in order to find the answer. After I caught more than one thousand slugs, I still did not have the answer. During sitting meditation one night, while I was contemplating my breathing, suddenly the image of the slugs appeared in front of me and I realized that maybe this is the message my mentor wanted to tell me, but I wanted to confirm whether it was true. That night I stayed in the greenhouse for two and a half hours. I started to catch the slugs and not long after, suddenly I saw something I have not seen before. I felt joy arise. Yes, this is it!</p>
<p>As my mentors gave me the opportunity to take care of the greenhouse, I realized that working in the greenhouse is not separate from my practice. Every time I take care of the greenhouse, I am, at the same time, taking care of myself and others. Whatever happens in the greenhouse also happens to me and this is what my mentors wished for me to practice. I need to learn how to take care of myself and to find my own way to cultivate joy and happiness in my daily life, to know how to water the wholesome seeds within me and to take care of the unwholesome seeds when they manifest. I always come back to myself to listen to the voices in me and to understand a little more about them, because they are my little friends within and have been with me for a long time. In the past I did not know they were there and I always neglected them. When they came I had a tendency to not welcome them and to try to escape because the feeling was so unpleasant. Now I know that l have to recognize, identify, and spend some time with them when they arise. This is an opportunity for me to express my love and care for them. By doing this I have built a relationship with them. I am starting to understand a little bit more about myself and my parents — about why they suffered in the past, because the suffering I have now is also the suffering of my parents, who have been carrying it for a long time, and I will continue to practice for them.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is happiness. This energy can help me to recognize and to take good care of suffering. The energy of happiness can heal suffering. When the suffering has been taken care of by the energies of compassion and love, I can still continue to enjoy my life and I won’t get carried away by suffering day and night. The way of taking care of suffering is the way of healing. When healing is taking place, I am already in the process of transformation. I do not need to do many things in order to transform suffering, because everything is organic. I just allow myself to be nourished by wholesome energy everyday and this makes me much lighter and more at ease. I can enjoy nature and practice together with the sangha. This can help me to embrace suffering when it manifests. That is very helpful. It is just like what my mentor said, when the vegetables grow strong enough, uprooting the weeds is easier.</p>
<p>My suffering has a lot to do with the thoughts that I produce every day. I have a tendency to perceive things in a negative way and to not always be open to the different views of the people who work with me. Sometimes I feel others have to follow my way of doing things and so the way I speak becomes unmindful, and those people may suffer once they get close to me. That is my habit energy. I can feel that these negative energies are not operating independently, that they are connecting to each other and functioning at the same time. They are not separate from each other. Once the distorted views in me are in contact with the negative mental formations, they bring about an unpleasant feeling. Sometimes this affects some part of my body and makes me feel uncomfortable. If I am not aware of this, they will keep feeding each other again and again, and then l suffer day and night and maybe more. Once I can recognize my perceptions and am able to stop, I have a chance to ask myself, “Am I sure?” I am then able to come back to myself. With appropriate attention, the negative energies are taken care of by mindfulness and compassion. These wholesome energies start to lead them in a more positive way. When the positive energies are taking place, soon after they bring me a pleasant feeling and my way of looking at things is also led in a positive way. I need to keep practicing in my daily life to discover more about myself. There is no end to the process. I have gratitude for my mentors, because they know what kind of nourishment and practice is most important for me now. I can see how important it is to take refuge in mentors.</p>
<p>I am still young in the practice and I hope that I can continue to have the guidance and support of my mentors and the sangha. Every morning I offer happiness to my mentor while we enjoy a cup of tea and listen to the birds singing. This is also an opportunity for me to ask him questions about the practice and thanks to his compassion and understanding, I can receive and learn many things about the practice from him. To me, these are the most precious moments in my life.</p>
<p>In the past, I thought that happiness is somewhere else and that there may be something better than home, that I needed to pursue something in order to gain happiness. But when I achieved that something and still could not feel happy, I continued to look for for another kind of happiness.</p>
<p>One morning while having a cup of tea in silence with my mentor, I suddenly realized that happiness is in the here and now. Gratitude, joy, and peace are in this moment. It is already happiness. What else could l wish for? How lucky I am to be a monk and to be practicing together with the sangha here. Thay and our elder brothers and sisters established Plum Village, and I can see that all the conditions from the past until now were not necessarily easy. I will cherish my life here and the conditions that have been created by Thay and the sangha.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I received two koans from my mentor. The first one is, “The lizard and the frog can help to eat some of the slugs, but they cannot eat all of the slugs.” Why is that? The second one is, “Why do the slugs only eat the vegetables and not the weeds?” Again, why is that? These two koans are insights from my mentor. He has thrown them to me, but I am still cooking them and I hope that I can tell you more in the future.</p>

            <div class="author">Brother Chân Trời Thiện Chí</div>
            <p>Shortly after the pandemic began, my mother told me that she felt lonely. I called her every week – even twice a week – during that time, but that was clearly not enough. Since I knew my mom loves mirrors, I decided to craft a gift for her: an enchanting, miraculous mirror that would speak with Thay’s voice to comfort her. I wanted it to look creative, old and a little mysterious, with a classic oval shape. Imagining it lit up a Buddha’s smile in my chest. I thought, “Yes! The glass should spill out of the mirror frame and reveal the Gatha for looking into the mirror.” With this fire of inspiration, immense determination, power and sweet excitement began to circulate in my body. It was easy to find some recycled materials and get started. But soon the difficulties began to overwhelm me.</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-troi-thien-chi5brot" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-troi-thien-chi/5Esj8EcKg7-1836.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>Firstly, building the frame was not easy – it took me months. I did not know how to attach the clay to the wooden backboard, and the shape I envisioned was rather complicated, with many minute details and bent inward like a bow. I put in a lot of effort, but it did not work out well. Eventually I had to let go of the project. Despair spread in me.</p>
<p>After a break of about two months, I stumbled across a wire mesh that I could use as a skeleton for the clay, in combination with small particles attached with nails. My optimism returned, and new creativity sprang back to life. My rhythm was slower now, but in time the shape of the mirror began to reveal itself. As I worked, I realised that I could neither plan the time ahead to completion, nor the outcome. In fact I began to think, “Am I making the mirror or is the mirror using me as a condition to manifest?”</p>
<img id="articlephotosbrother-chan-troi-thien-chi21767317541562549611291283397034335052574932n" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/brother-chan-troi-thien-chi/2x04LOXRMu-2000.jpeg" decoding="async">
<p>When the clay had finally dried, starting the painting was a great joy. However, the colours did not turn out quite right. Jokingly, a brother told me with a big smile, “You know Br. Thiện Chí, the mirror looks a bit like something out of a horror movie.” Fortunately, one of our lay friends, who is a professional antique restorer, helped me make the frame more genuine.</p>
<p>When my mother eventually opened the big package by mail from France, she was so happy and excited. I thought to myself, “If only I could see her face when she unwraps it and sees the mirror. Her smile is worth all my efforts.” The mirror now enjoys a sunny spot in my mother’s bedroom, spreading Thay’s words bathed in light all over the room: “True happiness is a heart that loves and a mind that is wide open” is what it reads in Bulgarian.</p>

            <div class="author">Brother Chân Pháp Hội</div>
            <p><em>Brother Phap Hoi has been connected with the Plum Village Newsletter for many years. This year's Newsletter editorial team had the chance to sit down with him to listen to him recount some memorable moments. The following is an excerpt from the interview.</em></p>
<h2>Memorable Moments</h2>
<p>The <em>Plum Village Newsletter</em> editorial team works to create a plate of spiritual food to offer to the world. Many people respect Thay, wish to learn Thay’s teachings, and at the same time are interested in knowing about the sangha's activities during the past year. Thay always placed great importance on this spiritual food. In fact, Thay was the chief editor, and a very careful and serious one, of the annual Newsletter* for many years. Along the way, Thay has shown the brothers and sisters many things about how to create this kind of spiritual food.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be involved with the Newsletter from early on. After ordaining in 1997, I followed the footsteps of Br. Phap An, Phap Kham, and other elder sisters and brothers in assisting Thay with the 1998 Newsletter. I felt that Thay expended a great deal of energy and spirit on each article, editing word-by-word and phrase-by-phrase clearly. This helped us to understand the Newsletter's essence and how to express the Plum Village style.</p>
<p>Thay was very happy that the Newsletter* only published positive, high quality news and was not interspersed with advertising. The content came not only from Thay, but also from the insights of the practice of his monastic and lay disciples. Therefore, the Newsletter expressed, from many different angles, insights on happiness in the practice, how the sangha was contributing to the world, and also contained archival material; Accounts of Thay's teaching tours, or the first steps on a new land to continue the spiritual ancestors there, or descriptions of new ways of practice being applied… they were all recorded. These later became key elements in the formation, development and history of Plum Village.</p>
<p>The publication of the Newsletter has become a tradition that many people look forward to and is lovingly called by its familiar name <strong>“The Tet Times”</strong>.<span class="note"><i>Tet</i> is the Vietnamese word for the Lunar New Year celebrated by many Asian and international communities around the world.</span> Thay hoped for it to be a gift for the Lunar New Year, so we usually published it before Tet, in time to print and post to everyone. The editorial team therefore was also under time pressure.</p>
<p>Thay was very active and open to new and more effective ways of working. Even though the Newsletter is only published once a year, it is of very high quality. Its content carries the flavor of Zen as well as realistically describing the process and results of Plum Village's socially engaged actions. Thay placed a great deal of energy into calling for support for charitable work. This work is now done differently compared to the past and is very effective. It also shows that practitioners are not only focused on their practice but also help and contribute to the world.</p>
<p>I had written a short article before I ordained about my happiness living in the sangha. The article was very naive, just listing my joys of immersing in Plum Village life. I described how we practiced, what my room was like, how I lived, how happy I was with it, and an anecdote about a cat that could not bear the Winter cold and sought warmth in my room every night. Br. Phap An also had the creative idea to publish a Shining Light letter, which had been given to me by the sangha, but with the name changed. Back then, the vivid reality of sangha life was often reflected in the <em>Newsletter</em> in that way.</p>
<p>Through the process of creating the Newsletter, the editorial team had the chance to learn from Thay and to be with Thay. Thay was a very professional and an excellent editor. There were times we were under pressure and our energy was no longer fresh. We did not recognize this, but Thay did. Even though it was close to the deadline, Thay still said, “Now, let's take a break. Don't do anymore. Let Thay fry rice for everyone.” Work was never as important as the practice of Thay's disciples. Working with Thay was not just about learning the skills of making the Newsletter, it was also learning how to take care of ourselves and how to be happy while working. That was the important thing. We can also apply this spirit to working with Thay's books. Those who had the opportunity to work with Thay on his books and the <em>Newsletter</em> learned much about how to clearly express our spiritual life through them.</p>
<p>When I came to Plum Village I brought with me a new Vietnamese font type software. The font was very beautiful and easier to use with computers. At the time in Plum Village we were using a very old Apple Macintosh and the Vietnamese font in it was usable and had many limitations. Thay was designing the <em>Daily Chanting Book</em> using the old font. The lay friend in charge of the computer suggested installing the new font. Sr. Thoai Nghiem volunteered to re-type all the sutras using the new font and she had to do so quickly, therefore even though there were still many errors, she had to overlook them in order for the text to be converted into the new style. Back then computers did not have font conversion systems like they do now and we still needed many humans to correct the grammar and spelling. I am from the North of Vietnam, so I am quite comfortable with this kind of work, which Thay called “worm catching”.</p>
<p>Thay taught us what words to use so that the language was in keeping with Plum Village principles. Not every word could be used. Thay himself paid great attention to that. Even though Thay had a deep mastery of language, literature, and Vietnamese culture, he was always willing to accept and learn from his disciples new ways of using language. I saw clearly that as a disciple, I benefited greatly from Thay and Thay was also always at the forefront of learning along with his disciples.</p>
<p>Thay was not afraid of using the dictionary. With words that carried different meanings, Thay went in search of their roots and their specific definitions to ensure that they were used correctly. At times, Thay was very insistent on using the meaning he wanted even though people could not understand it yet. For example the word <em>awakening</em> in Vietnamese is <em>tỉnh thức</em>. When Thay returned to Vietnam after many years he discovered that due to typing or copying errors, many people understood it as <em>tính thức</em> (consciousness) and interpreted it accordingly, leading to misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Sometimes I thought I understood what Thay's intention was, but it turned out to be otherwise. One year, Tet was approaching and the sangha was joyfully making preparations. A small group and myself joined Thay to work on the Newsletter. Thay edited the articles with all his heart whereas I, being young, wanting to play and waning in interest, worked quickly and half-heartedly. Normally Thay only signed <em>nh</em> on the draft manuscripts. That day after returning from an outing, I received a manuscript with his full signature <em>Thich Nhat Hanh</em>. I was very surprised and scared because I understood then that Thay took even the drafts very seriously. I am the only person to have ever received Thay's full signature on a draft manuscript. I tried to understand the meaning behind it - I was not working wholeheartedly and I was reminded of it. Thay could go over one article eight to ten times, refusing to ignore any errors if they were still there. At the time I was still busy playing and did not work wholeheartedly. Later on, the incident became a memory between teacher and disciple. Perhaps this will go down in Plum Village history as a “one and only” occurrence.</p>
<p>I always collected the manuscripts with Thay's signature and stored them in the Plum Village archive. I then had to leave France for visa reasons and was away for twelve years. The sangha went through so many changes during that time, including to the storage areas, and I was not able to find the manuscripts again.</p>
<p>In the past I also collected the draft calligraphies of the parallel verses that Thay wrote [on oblong wooden plaques] for the meditation halls of each hamlet. Thay worked on the parallel verses wholeheartedly, carefully balancing the words and verses. They were outstanding and admired by everyone. In terms of form, Thay also had to practice to write beautifully. Thay would first try it out on a piece of paper to see if there was the right amount of space between the words and in the margins above, below, and at the sides. Then Thay wrote each word on a piece of paper, positioned the paper on the wooden plaque, and took a photo of each word. I was able to collect these drafts. They are sometimes more valuable than the final versions because they were unique, whereas the final versions could be reprinted in their hundreds and thousands. I was very interested in the drafts because I could feel Thay's heart, energy, and reverence in every detail. Although some words required more space than others, Thay could always manage to balance them out wonderfully. Therefore, while working with Thay on books and the Newsletter, I learned and grew a great deal. At the same time, I knew that I was not yet able to fulfill Thay's wishes for me.</p>
<p>Later on I stopped working on books so that the opportunity could be given to others, and I worked in other areas of the sangha. Once a sister, after compiling one of Thay's books, brought it to him to edit. Afterwards she asked Br. Phap Niem and me, why had she not received any praise from Thay this time? The two of us laughed and told her it was fine; it was a chance for Thay to train us to be happy while working with the books and to see it as a part of our practice. Thay often praised us when we first began our work. But afterwards we had to know how to work happily with whatever Thay had entrusted to us, and not wait for praise before we could be happy. According to the practice transmitted to us by Thay, we must have happiness during our work and not wait until its completion. <em>That</em> is the essence of the practice, it is not merely about the work.</p>

            <div class="author">Dharmacharya Shantum Seth</div>
            <p>When I first met Thay in 1987 he was 61, a couple of years younger than I am now.  Yet it seemed to me then and seems to me still, that he had already got to where he wanted to go, whether it was in his form of Engaged Buddhism or in his personal awakening. I can imagine him smiling if he were to read this, and gently saying: “Shantum the whole point of this practice is not to go anywhere, but to be in the here and now.”</p>
<p>Our first meeting was at the Ojai foundation in California. He was to lead a week-long retreat for artists there. More than a hundred of us were seated under a large oak. Few of us had even heard his name before and I remember everyone referring to him as ‘Kick the Can’.</p>
<p>I was helping with the recording and as I was setting up the equipment. I looked up and saw a monk in simple brown robes gliding towards the tree, which everyone called the ‘Teaching Tree’. He walked with gentle deliberation. Involuntarily we left whatever we were doing and rose from our seats and bowed to him. He had an extraordinary sense of presence.</p>
<p>All he did and said was very simple. He sat still, we listened to a bell, he taught and then he walked. For years I had been searching for some way to be peaceful, and now I could feel that sense of peace with each step and each breath that we took with him.</p>
<p>I don't think he noticed me at all, but when we were seeing him off, he looked directly at me and said as his hands gestured a namaste, “Bring the Buddha Dharma back to India”.</p>
<p>This encounter stayed with me. When I returned to India a few months later, I found I really wanted to see him again. On an impulse, I wrote to him.  I offered to host him, should he ever want to visit India. But the letter lay on my desk for another three months before I found the confidence to post it.</p>
<p>To my surprise and joy he responded. Could I organise a Buddhist pilgrimage for him and 30 of his students? I jumped at the chance to connect with him again.</p>
<p>We started in Delhi, at our home at 8 Rajaji Marg.  My family was all there, slightly sceptical but very curious. Thay sat with us in the garden by the lily pond, where he showed us how to walk with his kind of intense mindfulness. My parents and siblings silently followed in his footsteps. I think they could not help but feel his magnetism.</p>
<p>For the next 35 days I travelled with Thay through Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. I had been to some of these sites since I had been brought up in Patna, but visiting them again with Thay was altogether a different experience. He had just finished writing the biography of the Buddha, “Old Path White Clouds,” and at each of these sites, he brought the Buddha alive to us.</p>
<p>It was wonderful to hear the stories and drama of the Buddha's life through Thay’s eyes. The Buddha to him was not a God, but a real person, comfortable with people from all walks of life, able to connect with beggars and farmers, rich and poor, young and old, doctors, teachers, Dalits, Brahmins, kings, prostitutes; and even with animals, insects, trees, crops and flowers.</p>
<p>Thay was like a happy and curious child meeting his teacher everywhere he travelled - meditating in the same caves and rocks the Buddha may have sat on, crossing the same rivers, eating the same food and greeting the children, descended from the children the Buddha met. But his favourite was Vulture Peak, the hilltop in Rajgir from where the Buddha loved to watch the sunset.</p>
<p>It was at Vulture Peak, Thay said that his own Buddha Eyes had opened some years before. It was also on Vulture Peak he ordained his first three monastic disciples. It was here too that he transmitted his lay teachings that had been extracted from the ancient Buddhist texts and condensed to what he called the 14 Mindfulness Trainings and the 5 Precepts. These trainings are a clear set of guidelines on how to live a good life - good in a simple, happy and peaceful way -  in these confusing  times.</p>
<p>We sat under trees and listened to Thay talk about the Buddha’s teachings. Thay held my hand without saying a word. At that moment I felt I was looking with his eyes and that everything is interconnected. I had never thought of these matters, but at that moment I understood what he was saying, that nothing is born and nothing dies. He turned to look at me and pointing to the turban on my head, he said, “Shantum, the matter of life and death is as urgent as if your turban is on fire.”</p>
<p>On a full moon night in Kushinagar, where the Buddha had died, Thay and Sister Chan Khong, who was the first nun he had ordained, shaved my head. They were eager for me to be a monk, and I wanted it too, but I was not sure.  A few days later in Lumbini, Thay presented me with a monastic robe. I did not wear it, but kept it for a few years.</p>
<p>I felt that I wasn't cut out to be a monk. I wanted to be in the thick of life, with all the mess of relationships and daily struggles and not sheltered in a monastery. When I said this to Thay, he warned me that it was far more difficult to practice outside than inside the monastery, but he did not discourage me to marry.</p>
<p>I remember mentioning to him once that I often find it difficult to make choices in different situations, especially when the competing options are all good.  His answer, both simple and profound, has remained a constant teaching for me: “It does not matter what you do, but how you do it.”</p>
<p>When I decided to get married, I introduced Gitu, my wife to be, to Thay. He said she reminded him of Yashodhara. Gitu responded with a naughty smile that she would rather be Sujata, who had offered the young Siddhartha kheer before his enlightenment, rather than Yashodhara, his wife whom he had left to search for the path of awakening. Thay smiled.</p>
<p>In fact, when I did marry, he conducted the commitment ceremony himself. We only went to him for a private blessing but he insisted he would perform the ceremony  himself before the whole community in the meditation hall in Plum Village, the monastery he founded in France after he was exiled from Vietnam.</p>
<p>He asked us to repeat every full moon night the vows of love that he had just given us, and we have never missed doing that for a single full moon night in the last 25 years. It has been a regular reminder of our vows and deepened our trust and understanding of each other. It has also been a wonderful way of enjoying the moon together and being aware of its cycle.</p>
<p>Gitu and I had been married nearly a year when Thay visited India again with a group of about 12 monastics. While we were in the village of Sujata, near Bodh Gaya, we visited a school where a large number of people from the village gathered. Thay was teaching how to help people communicate.</p>
<p>Gitu and I were sitting next to him and he turned to Gitu and asked, what is it that irritates you or gets you angry about Shantum? He asked her to act it out and speak openly in front of the village audience of more than a 100 people. Gitu felt embarrassed to answer, but Thay encouraged her, saying that this would be a teaching to help in skillful communication. He suggested that Gitu use compassionate speech. So we did what we call “Dharma drama”! She said to me in a sweet way how it irritates her that I come late to meal times and allow the food to get cold. It was something many young women could relate to, she felt. Thay suggested to me that I do not react or say anything as an immediate response to what Gitu was sharing, and instead, to listen deeply; to know that it was important for Gitu to be able to share her irritation and for me to listen with my full attention, and to try and listen with a non-judgemental mind.</p>
<p>It was very touching. I am not sure what the others gleaned from this, but it taught me not only that I should not be late for meals and make people wait for me, but also to listen deeply and voice my appreciation for Gitu. It is not something that came easily to me being brought up in an Indian culture.</p>
<p>Afterwards as I sat with Thay in his room sharing a cup of oolong tea that he loved, I brought this up, hoping he may be able to cure me of the habit. I asked him rather naively “Thay I am always late… what should I do?” His response was terse, “Leave early!”</p>
<p>Gitu and I were with Thay in 1999 while he was on a tour in the US. One day Thay came up to me and told me that my name had been recommended to be ordained as a Dharmacharya. This would mean that I would now be ‘transmitted the lamp’ and be authorised to teach as a representative of Thay, who is the 42nd generation of the Chinese Zen Master Linji’s lineage.</p>
<p><code> </code>I asked Thay who had recommended my name and he said “Thay”. I was pleased and surprised, but did not feel ready. When I told him my doubts, Thay said he had confidence in me. Gitu and I decided to go and live in PV for a while so that I would feel more confident to take on my new role as a Dharma Teacher. Not that I could meet Thay every day – he lived in a hermitage away from the monastery and visited twice a week to teach at one of the Plum Village hamlets, where hundreds of people would gather to hear him speak.</p>
<p>He always treated Gitu and me with special fondness, often stopping to ask whenever he saw us how we were doing. When Gitu became pregnant, he would ask not only about Gitu, but also of the baby in her womb.</p>
<p>He would ask me too if I was enjoying speaking with the baby in the womb. He also suggested reading the Lotus sutra to the unborn baby. The Lotus Sutra is one of the most revered Buddhist texts that claims that anyone can awaken the Buddha in them.</p>
<p>Once when we were sitting on the grass, he suggested that I speak to Gitu as if I was the baby in the womb. He explained that in his native Vietnamese, the womb is called the palace of the child, a refuge where the baby feels safe. I felt very embarrassed to do what he asked as there were many people sitting there with us. But there was no arguing with Thay so I bent down and addressed Gitu as the baby in her womb.</p>
<p>It was a most intimate conversation that developed. Thank you, I said, for carrying me in your womb and taking care of me. Thank you for nourishing me, for feeding me, for breathing for me. Thank you for taking me for a walk to the sunset point each evening and describing the beauty to me. Thank you for speaking with me and loving me. Thank you for taking care of what you eat and drink and consume. I smile when you smile. I can feel your change of emotions and know when you are happy or disturbed. And how are you doing?  Are you enjoying it? Is it difficult? How do you feel when I kick you? I asked as if I was the baby in Gitu's womb. All at once, I could see that Thay and even the Buddha had once been babies in the womb, like me.</p>
<p>It was also to Thay that I owe the way I earn my livelihood. I was then working at the United Nations and decided to take only one dollar a year and needed to find another way of making a livelihood.</p>
<p>After my first pilgrimage with Thay, he had suggested that I organise pilgrimages in the Buddha's footsteps every year. I joyfully accepted the challenge and at first was doing it once a year, but eventually turned this into my livelihood and have been leading this pilgrimage for more than 30 years now.</p>
<p>Since my first pilgrimage with Thay, I have made it a point to go and stay with Thay for about a month each year, wherever he was; whether in Plum Village or in some other country where he went to teach. There have been many wonderful interactions with Thay over the years thereafter, especially during his historic trip to India in 2008… but that is another story.</p>
<p>He has been my guide, teacher and wise friend.</p>

<h2>My first retreat as a 10-year-old</h2>
<p>My parents and I attended our first family retreat with Thích Nhất Hạnh (Thay) and the Sangha in 1998 at the OMEGA Institute in New York State. Before going on this retreat, my mom had read several of Thay’s books. From this, she had begun integrating some of Thay’s teachings into her work as a visiting artist in high schools. My dad is a physician and had his own medical practice. As a family we were interested in exploring more about the practice of mindfulness – so we all agreed to go on a new adventure and attend Thay’s next North American retreat!</p>
<p>Our very first impression of the monastic community was quite memorable. As we first drove up to the retreat centre upon arrival, several sisters were walking along the grass near a pond. We had never seen or met a Buddhist monastic before. The image was beautiful. A light breeze was gently blowing their robes and they were smiling as they slowly walked. Then, suddenly, some large geese started honking and running towards them! The sisters immediately started running away from the geese, but rather than panicking or being frightened, they began laughing as they ran. My parents and I also began laughing and my mom turned to me and said, “I think we are home”.</p>
<p>After this experience, we attended the family retreat each year that Thay and the Sangha came to North America — so I had the joy growing up attending Plum Village’s children’s program and then the teen program. Happily, not long after I graduated from the teen program, Thay and the Sangha started the Wake Up Movement for “young adults” and I had the opportunity to participate in the 2011 East Coast Wake Up Tour. On this tour, a group of monastics and lay friends in their 20s and 30s travelled to Universities across the East Coast of the USA (including Yale, Harvard and Brown). I have continued to practice closely with the Sangha, becoming a member of the Order of Interbeing in 2015. I am a founding member of the Wake Up Toronto Sangha and currently part of the North American Wake Up Care Taking Council.</p>
<h2>Inspiration to bring the PV practice into healthcare settings</h2>
<p>A few specific life experiences played a role in my interest to research the application of mindfulness in healthcare settings: 1) Growing up with a father who was a physician; 2) An interest in caring for caregivers (having been close to many teachers growing up with my mom working as an artist in elementary/high-schools); and 3) Experiencing my own illness and subsequent hospital stay/admission when I was 15 years old.</p>
<p>I was hospitalized after a combination of viruses triggered an autoimmune response that overactivated my immune system. The first night I was in the hospital, the doctors told me and my parents that they did not know if I would make it through the night. Through this first night, and over the course of my hospital stay – which included a seemingly never-ending battery of tests – my family drew upon many of the Plum Village practices to support us. For example, during procedures we would sing Plum Village songs and come home to our breathing. Each morning during hospital rounds, I would be asked about the parts of my body that were in pain. After this, my mom would guide me through a deep relaxation practice so that I would also spend time each morning sending gratitude and love to my body. The practice of deep relaxation (sometimes called a body scan) also helped me become aware of the parts my body that were free of pain, even if this was just my left pinky toe. Since my hospital experience, I have been asked when I began using the practice of mindfulness to heal. My answer is that through mindfulness, we can begin to heal at the very same time that we become ill, they are not separate and there is no need to wait.</p>
<p>My interest in bringing mindfulness to healthcare was furthered during my Masters degree, which focused on integrating mindfulness and the teachings of Thích Nhất Hạnh into the sector of education, along with my time as the international coordinator for Wake Up schools (an initiative started by Thay and the Sangha to support the cultivation of Mindfulness in educational settings). Through my graduate studies I was introduced to the scientific literature about burnout amongst caring professions (particularly educators and clinicians).</p>
<p>These different life experiences led me to be interested in exploring how healthcare/occupational environments could be spaces where clinicians could flourish and thrive, rather than burnout. I was particularly inspired by a conversation Thay had with the dean of the School of Public Health at Harvard. During this conversation Thay proposed that everyone who is part of a community of health should learn how to live in such a way that the environment of the healthcare practitioner is also healthy. Thay suggested that how healthcare practitioners eat, walk and work could create an environment filled with joy and happiness, so that the health community itself was an instrument of healthy change. Thay proposed that this kind of environment would benefit the health of everyone in the community, including patients, families, clinicians, and administrators.</p>
<p>From my own lived experience growing up with Thay’s teachings, along with researching their integration into education settings, I had already begun the work of considering how to bridge the knowledge streams of science and Dharma. From these experiences, I knew that these two knowledge streams had the potential to be complementary. I also knew that there were questions and challenges about how to present the Dharma in a way that was acceptable and accessible within the setting of healthcare. My novel background as both an academic researcher and long-term practitioner with Plum Village offered me a unique perspective and access to the teachings that I hoped could be of service to both the international healthcare community and the Plum Village community. Combined with my aspiration to further develop my skills as a researcher and continue my academic learning journey, along with a gentle push from one of my mentors in Toronto Michele Chaban, I decided to apply to the PhD program at the University of Toronto with the aim to study the impact of mindfulness on physician wellbeing.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>There is growing interest within the sector of healthcare to address systemic issues such as burnout. Mindfulness has been recommended across the literature as one potentially effective modality. While the evidence-base for mindfulness has generated interest, there are significant challenges when attempting to address systemic change within healthcare delivery systems. These challenges include practical concerns and skepticism about integrating knowledge from outside the dominant cultural system in relation to acceptability, applicability and feasibility. There are also barriers that stem from long-standing social and cultural elements embedded within the context of medical culture. Based on the existing literature, along with data generated from the physicians who participated in my PhD research study, these socially and culturally embedded barriers include competition, perfectionism, individualism, demanding workloads and higher value placed on “achievement” and “success” than “self-care” and “work/life balance”.</p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, I drew upon the very same bodies of knowledge which could be seen to have fostered these barriers — being the traditions of science and the Dharma. On the scientific end, I drew upon the academic tradition of evidence and rigour to build a high-quality research study that would be acceptable to the scientific community and culture of medicine. Simultaneously, I took refuge in Thay, the Sangha and my own practice. In particular, I took inspiration from Thay’s many years of perseverance in the face of great challenge and difficulty. Over the course of working on my PhD, I would return to writings and talks from Thay for inspiration. As I wrote my dissertation, I would sometimes imagine him peering over my shoulder, encouraging me to keep going no matter how tired I felt or how challenging the work was. It is in this spirit that my 400-page dissertation begins with the following quote from Thay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Meditators since the beginning of time have known that they must use their own eyes and the language of their own times to express their insight. Wisdom is a living stream, not an icon to be preserved in a museum. Only when a practitioner finds the spring of wisdom in his or her own life can it flow to future generations. Keeping the torch of wisdom glowing is the work of all of us who know how to clear a path through the forest in order to walk on ahead.”</p>
<p>Thích Nhất Hạnh, The Sun My Heart p.vii</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote provided ongoing encouragement throughout my PhD journey. In addition to encouragement, this quote — along with many other invitations across Thay’s body of work to update and iterate the Dharma —- provided me with a sense of permission from Thay to innovate and add my own voice to the ongoing adaptation and application of the Dharma. Taking refuge in the Sangha also manifested in a very pragmatic way through the establishment of a Monastic Advisory Committee, which I formally set up as part of my PhD process.</p>
<h2>Support &amp; Collaboration with Thích Nhất Hạnh &amp; Plum Village</h2>
<p>I begin this section with a deep bow of gratitude to the Plum Village monastic community, who have been a meaningful support across so much of my life. Every retreat, teaching tour, online Dharma talk, recording on the Plum Village app, etc. have been made possible by the incredible humans who have chosen to walk the monastic path. To support my PhD research study, a Plum Village Monastic Advisory Committee (MAC) was established. The members of the Monastic Advisory Committee for my PhD included Br. Phap Dung, Br. Phap Huu, Br. Phap Linh and Sr. Hien Nghiem. As members of the MAC, they were invited to provide feedback across all phases of the research study, including program development/implementation, data analysis and final thesis write up — along with collaboration on future publications.  Their feedback helped to guide the study and ground the work in the teachings and language of Thay and the Plum Village community.</p>
<h2>Mindfulness in Healthcare: A brief history &amp; overview of my research study</h2>
<p>The popularity and application of mindfulness in contemporary settings has been growing across key sectors of society, including healthcare, education, workplace and law. Within the scientific literature, mindfulness is credited as having a wide range of potential health benefits, including reduced anxiety and stress, along with increased wellbeing, self-regulation, cognitive performance, emotional-regulation, motor skills, academic performance, empathy and greater connection between brain regions associated with “prosocial behaviours” such as compassion. Within the context of healthcare, programs – often called Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) – have been researched and delivered to patient populations. These include mindfulness programs developed for patients with chronic pain, relapse in depression, cancer patients, adolescents with chronic illness and addiction recovery. To date, none of the published mindfulness-based interventions have been explicitly/primarily based in the teachings of Thích Nhất Hạnh. Therefore, my thesis research study aspires to contribute an innovative and novel approach to the field of healthcare, while simultaneously supporting the work and teachings of the wider Plum village community.</p>
<h2>A brief overview of my PhD research study</h2>
<p>My PhD research study was conducted with 45 physicians from across different specialties (e.g. surgery, emergency department, family medicine etc.) who participated in a five-week mindfulness training program delivered at a hospital in Toronto, Canada. The program was called the “Applied Mindfulness training Program for Medical Personnel” or AMP-MP for short. I developed this program based on my training and practice with Thích Nhất Hạnh and the Plum Village community. The program was facilitated by two long-term Plum Village practitioners, who are both registered clinicians, David Viafora and Dagmara Urbanowicz. I was present at each session as a “participant observer” to take research field notes and help with administrative support. Following the completion of the program, I conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with 28 of the physicians. Analysis of the interviews showed that participants’ experience of mindfulness benefitted their personal sense of wellbeing, along with enhancing their interactions with their patients, colleagues, and administrators. The participants describe Thích Nhất Hạnh’s teachings as well liked/enjoyable/practical and highly applicable to their daily life.</p>
<p>I am deeply grateful to each participant for sharing their experience and stories with me. As I write this reflection, I am reminded of one surgeon in particular who, during the first session, expressed that they did not believe in this <em>“mindfulness stuff”</em>, and then in their post-program interview stated that they <em>“fell in love with the bell”</em> and had considered <em>“stealing the bell”</em> at the end of the program, so they could ring it for their colleagues before their next surgery. Below are some direct quotes from the study participants which illustrate – in their own words – their experience of the practice.</p>
<p>“I also found the awareness of breath really helpful especially. I've been operating almost every day the past month and it gets stressful and the days are really long and fast-paced and we don't really stop to eat or do anything, so, usually in between patients there is just a few minutes so I found just taking the few minutes to breathe during those kind of transitions really helpful just to clear my head and then quickly move on to the next patient.” – <em>Ophthalmologist</em></p>
<p>“I think I will definitely continue it because I find that by the end of the day, or during my day, my day is going more smoothly and if my day goes more smoothly, I end up at the end of the day with a happier day and so that means I come home happier. So, I don't bring back all of the frustration and stuff that was happening through the day. I think, those deep breaths in between patients, the mindful walking that I can do is great.” – <em>Rheumatologist</em></p>
<p>“I spoke about the breathing, so you come back to your mindfulness breathing and it helps you to cope with almost every situation. Like, you have that interaction with a patient. So, you can immediately react or you can just pause for even [a second?], when you feel it, but you pause and you take a breath and you do it twice and then it gives you some time to think. And then if you're relaxed, it gives you immediately the way to react differently, better.” – <em>Surgeon</em></p>
<h2>No beginning, no end</h2>
<p>There is so much more that could be shared about the integration of Thay’s work into healthcare settings than can fit into this one article. Happily, we know from Thay that by looking deeply we can see there is no beginning or end. So, while in the historical dimension this article is concluding, my deep aspirations are to continue working and collaborating with the PV monastic and lay communities to bring the practice into healthcare settings to cultivate a healthy and compassionate society.</p>

            <h1 id="parallax-press-and-the-journey-to-plum-village-through-books" class="chapter">Parallax Press and the Journey to Plum Village through Books</h1>
            <div class="author">Hisae Matsuda &amp; Terry Barber</div>
            <p>In 1986, four years after the founding of Plum Village, Thầy and some of his North American students published the book <em>Being Peace</em> in Berkeley, California. Thus, Thầy became the cofounder of Parallax Press, the publishing house of the Plum Village community in the United States, with the mission “to contribute to collective insight and awakening, bringing about a more joyful, healthy, and compassionate society” and make the Plum Village teachings accessible worldwide. Thirty-six years and more than 335 books later, Parallax Press keeps Thầy’s books in print and brings out twelve new works a year, which are distributed by Penguin Random House and available in bookshops everywhere. Current publisher Hisae Matsuda sat down with editorial director and lay Dharma teacher Terry Barber, the longest-serving member of the publishing team, to talk about how their lives have been enriched through reading and working on Thầy’s books.</p>
<p><strong>Hisae:</strong> How did you first come to Plum Village?</p>
<p><strong>Terry:</strong> In 1991, my studies and work were ending and I was ready for a change. For years I had been reading books about Buddhism and wanted to live in a temple or practice center. I knew for my life to move forward I needed the support of a daily schedule and practice community. One day someone put a copy of <em>Being Peace</em> into my hands and said, “I think you will like this!” and so I learned about Thầy. I thought, “If it’s possible, I’d like to go to <em>Thầy’s</em> practice center.” Soon after, I had the chance to attend his public talk in Los Angeles and a Day of Mindfulness at the retreat for environmentalists in Malibu. I was moved to hear Thầy address matters of social injustice; at that time it was the police beating of Rodney King, which had happened a few months before and was still in the news. I came to Plum Village in April 1992, hoping to stay indefinitely.</p>
<p>Hisae, how did you meet Thầy and come to Plum Village?</p>
<p><strong>Hisae:</strong> My introduction to Thầy was also in the early 1990s through books, and my first book was also <em>Being Peace</em>, followed by <em>The Miracle of Mindfulness</em>. The books lit a fire in me. I have such a debt of gratitude to the editors of Thầy’s first English books. In England, where I lived then, Thầy’s books were brought out by Judith Kendra at Rider Books—Judith is now a member of our board.</p>
<p>But it took me a long time, twenty-five years in fact, to set foot in Plum Village after reading <em>Being Peace</em>. In 1993, I was living in London with my husband and two little children, who were then just three and two years old. I was looking for a retreat that I could go to, to gain some peace of mind. But there were no Buddhist retreats that allowed children—most were very kid-unfriendly. Then I heard that Thầy was coming to England, and I was relieved and amazed that children were not only allowed to attend, but welcomed! I signed up and my two children and I went on retreat with Thầy in the countryside outside London. We had our first experience of walking meditation alongside a Zen master. Sister Chan Duc was the facilitator of my Dharma sharing family, and I still remember everything she said. Thầy and Sister Chan Duc left a very deep impression in me, but the serene way of life they modeled seemed inaccessible to me at that time. My life took many twists and turns, and I didn’t go to Plum Village until June 2018, after joining Parallax. The beauty of the place was exactly as I’d imagined, only even more so.</p>
<p>Terry, what were your first impressions and experiences of life in Plum Village?</p>
<p><strong>Terry:</strong> I loved the peace and beauty of the land and the hum of monastery life. The residential Sangha was small, with twelve to fifteen monks and nuns and five or six laypeople. At mealtimes in the Lower Hamlet, we all fit around one big square table. Thầy would sometimes join us, bringing a sweetness, informality, and a feeling of family. On my arrival I was told I could only stay for a week, since the three-week June retreat was about to begin. In the end, perhaps because of my enthusiasm for pot washing, I was asked if I’d like to stay on to help prepare rooms and staff the retreat. Listening to Thầy’s Dharma talks, my heart felt completely open, as though I’d been waiting to hear those words all my life.</p>
<p>I stayed on as staff for the summer retreat and was lucky to be in the Lower Hamlet where the Vietnamese families stayed and created a real community (non-Vietnamese retreatants and families stayed in the Upper Hamlet). There seemed to be so much happiness and freedom in just being together, interacting, living, and eating in a Vietnamese way. After dinner the songbooks came out. I don’t have words to describe the beauty and penetrating effect of the Vietnamese songs; many had been written by Thầy. At summer’s end came the first-ever plum harvest—not a commercial success! We were a crew of four or five laypeople who’d stayed on after the retreat. We were led by a friendly, well-intentioned local farmer who, knowing only grapes, was inexperienced with plums, even though they were a common local crop. Most of the plums we picked rotted in the heat before they got to the drying house. It was discouraging but, doubtless through the efforts of Sister Chan Khong, systems were put in place to ensure more efficient future harvests. It was enjoyable and tiring work, shaking the trees, gathering the plums from the ground, eating the sun-warmed fruit from the trees, and bringing buckets-full back to the kitchen for the sisters to make plum jam. To stay on for winter, I had to write a letter to Thầy, asking to be a resident. Somehow I was accepted. I stayed for six years in Plum Village, and then for three years at Green Mountain Dharma Center in Vermont.</p>
<p>I’m always moved by Thầy’s dedication to creating environments where people can find peace and healing, connect with nature and community, have the chance to look deeply, and learn ways to handle suffering and touch seeds of happiness and well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Hisae:</strong> How did you come to be at Parallax, Terry?</p>
<p><strong>Terry:</strong> While living in Plum Village and Green Mountain, I’d sometimes visit my family in California and spend time in the Parallax office, where I continued my work of transcribing Thầy’s Dharma talks. In spring 2001, my father entered his last illness and I went home to be with him. He passed away at the end of the year. I needed dental work and a job to pay for it, and Parallax seemed the logical place to apply. I began a few months later, packing and shipping book orders.</p>
<p>How did you come to work at Parallax, Hisae?</p>
<p><strong>Hisae:</strong> In 2016, I was at another press close to Parallax in Berkeley, and when the opportunity came up to join Parallax’s editorial team, I couldn’t say no. Even though it was a big leap of faith to leave my position, and I knew from the beginning that there would be challenges, Parallax offered an irresistible opportunity—to try to bring my values and inner spiritual life and my outer work together. One month into the new job, my son, Leo, took his own life on the day after the 2016 US election. It broke my heart. Somehow I struggled on for a while, but then I had to stop everything. During that hiatus, I had the time to go on retreat again, this time to Plum Village, finally. There, I began to find ways to heal and come back to life.</p>
<p>I was always so grateful to you, Terry, and to everyone at Parallax for holding the space for me to come back. I don’t think many workplaces have such a strong feeling of a Sangha, that sense of acceptance and support.</p>
<p>Terry, what are the changes you’ve seen at Parallax over the years and what are your aspirations for its future?</p>
<p><strong>Terry:</strong> Bridging distance, time zones, and ways of life between a monastery in France and a publishing office in California has always held challenges. It’s been heartening to see the Plum Village and Parallax Sanghas mature over the years, and to see the next generation of Plum Village teachers emerge and become authors. Significant changes have come with you, Hisae, as publisher. A publishing professional whose heart is with Thầy’s teachings and the Plum Village community is just what Parallax needed. From the outset you’ve dedicated yourself to growing a more integrated relationship with Plum Village and their editorial team. Parallax has become a tighter, more professional and transparent operation with a happy, caring staff who work together as a team. You have a keen sensibility for which books are appropriate for Parallax to publish, and you’ve acquired and edited some wonderful books. You’ve also ensured we’re regularly publishing Thầy’s scholarly works on our Palm Leaves imprint. I’d like to see the press continue in this same direction, helping to preserve Thầy’s legacy, collaborating with Plum Village, and serving the international community with nourishing books.</p>
<p>At Plum Village I found a tradition to be rooted in and a way ahead. At Parallax—as so many people meet Thầy through books—I’ve found a place where I can play a small role in making the Plum Village teachings more widely available, helping us as individuals and as a global community to navigate the times we’re in.</p>
<p>What are your aspirations for Parallax, Hisae?</p>
<p><strong>Hisae:</strong> My wish when I became publisher was to recognize what is most precious about our editorial program: the unique relationship with the Plum Village teachings, which are so alive in the world today and being shared in so many ways by Thầy’s students, who are now teachers in their own right. Reading a book is a very personal experience that affects you deeply for several days and may even change your life. Books by monastic and lay authors can help us face, embrace, and transform the suffering of our times, from personal and family trauma to social exclusion to war and environmental destruction, which are not unrelated to one another, of course. It is time for us to show how Thầy’s approach to peace—his inclusivity and nondiscrimination—is changing the world today, in ways large and small.</p>
<p>I want to continue putting processes in place and build the kind of strong (but flexible) backbone a small press needs to have continued success. When there’s trust, even really difficult things can fall into place; without it, even the smallest things can become obstacles. To build that trust, we have to practice.</p>
<p>I hope Parallax will be the publishing company that, according to legend, Thầy imagined in his meetings with the Parallax staff before my time: operating harmoniously like the bees and reaching and helping diverse audiences with books on authentic mindfulness practice. The Plum Village editorial team has been such a source of wisdom and support. I’m gladdened by the work of Sister Chan Duc and her team, bringing out Thầy’s previously unpublished books on the Palm Leaves Press imprint. Readers really seem to like the new books and want to go deeper.</p>
<p>Many who now enter the Plum Village tradition may never have met Thầy, yet they can absorb the teachings through all the different forms of media Plum Village now offers. The Dharma teachers ordained by Thầy are transmitting the teachings to the current generation of practitioners with courage, love, and integrity. We are so happy to be part of this community and to celebrate the fortieth anniversary of Plum Village in 2022.</p>

<h2>Finding the Path of Mindfulness</h2>
<p><em>Can you tell us some stories about how you found the path of mindfulness and how it has changed you?</em></p>
<p>In 1987 I found Thay’s book, <em>The Miracle of Mindfulness</em>, and started reading it. When I read the first story, about how to have unlimited time for yourself, I realized I wanted to bring this book into my math classes and read it to my students. I was certain they would get much benefit from it. The students have so much work and there is so much pressure on them that having unlimited time for themselves would be the greatest gift I could possibly give them.</p>
<p>Everyday I began math class reading from the book. When I finished, my students said they would like another book, so I read <em>The Sun, My Heart</em>, which was kind of the sequel. For me it was like reading science fiction. I didn’t know anyone who lived their life the way Thay described, and I didn’t know how one could go about beginning to live that way. At the end of the year, the seniors went off to do their special projects and came back to report on them. I was touched by one of the seniors who reported on his two weeks at a zen center in Washington, DC, where he went every day to meditate and to help out. He returned to school so invigorated; he was just beaming. The audience had an opportunity for a Q&amp;A about his report. A student asked, “Chris, I can see that your life has been changed by your experience and that you spent a lot of time sitting on a cushion. Can you tell us any other way in which your life is different?” Chris thought for a minute and then replied, &quot;There are many ways my life has been affected by my mindfulness practice. Most of them are very subtle and difficult to put into words, but I can tell you that I am less angry.&quot; When I heard this, I thought, &quot;Here is my teacher!&quot; And I said to Chris, &quot;I need to do what you’ve been doing. I need to begin a meditation practice.&quot;</p>
<p>That was the beginning of what led me to attend a retreat with Thay. Everything after that unfolded in a way that felt deeply right. It seemed fated.</p>
<h2>Bringing Mindfulness to Students</h2>
<p><em>Can you share more about how, as you were beginning to walk this path, you began to bring meditation into your community and classroom and also about the effects of sharing mindfulness with your students.</em></p>
<p>When I met Thay and began my personal meditation practice, I was not ready to bring the practice into the Quaker school  where I was teaching. I didn't see an opening for doing that. My own mindfulness practice was still very young. I focused my attention primarily on developing it. A few years later a new course was set up and required for all ninth grade students for one semester. Discovering it had a unit on health, I went to the teacher who was teaching the course and asked if I could offer one lesson on stress-reduction. When she said yes, I developed a lesson plan for teaching the ninth graders. I would have them for only 45 minutes. I knew whatever I did needed to be memorable. What were the students really interested in? I remembered from Frank McCourt’s book <em>Teacher Man</em>, (a book about the life of a teacher in inner city public schools) where he suggested that his high school students were interested in sex and food. When I thought about the teenagers I’d be teaching, I added one more thing, they were deeply interested in themselves. They were 14-year-olds trying to figure out who they were. What about introducing them to their minds?</p>
<p>The mind is often a part of ourselves that we don’t know much about, unknown. We know how to use it but, we don’t know what is happening inside when we do. So I invited my students to do an experiment, watching whatever happened in their minds for five minutes. I compared the mind to a stage where different things would come on to make appearances. They’d be there for a while and then leave. When we talked together about what they might see on their stages, they ended up realizing they might become aware of feelings, thoughts, sensations from the outer world and internal bodily sensations.</p>
<p>The students were prepared to just notice things as they appeared. I asked them if they thought there could be more than one thing on their stage at the same time. Students generally thought it might be possible but they weren’t sure. I then asked them whether their stage might be empty for part of the time. Very few thought that was possible. So we experimented by watching our minds and then shared experiences. When I asked how many had negative thoughts or feelings during the five minutes, almost everyone had. Most of these thoughts had to do with things that had yet to happen or had already happened, maybe a problem with a friend or parent and, occasionally, a problem with what was happening right in the moment as they didn’t like what they were doing. I went on to talk about how what’s going on in your mind affects the kind of life you’re living.</p>
<p>If many negative things are happening in your mind, it might be kind of a downer to be paying attention to them unless you can do something about it. So I said, “There is something you can do about it!” and together we all did this short guided Plum Village meditation:</p>
<p>Breathing in, I see myself as a flower, breathing out, I feel fresh. Breathing in, I see myself as a mountain, breathing out I feel solid…</p>
<p>The idea that their minds were having a powerful influence on their lives was planted and also that there was something they could do to make their minds more hospitable and positive.</p>
<p>When students returned [sometimes years later], some talked about remembering something I had read to them in class from Thich Nhat Hanh’s writing. Others remembered something I had talked about in the stress-reduction class. I was becoming aware that stress-reduction was not just a matter of school-related pressure. It was also the whole world starting to get stressed. I could see that mindfulness could become an extremely important tool, a way of coping, and an aide to doing more than just coping with the kind of world we were all moving into.</p>
<p>In my last two years of teaching I took the step of getting permission from the school principal to begin every one of my classes with five minutes of mindfulness. Sometimes we read a short poem or story having wisdom and intelligence from Thay or another teacher or poet. There was also weekly free writing where we all just recorded whatever was in our minds for five minutes. It was a revolutionary experience for many of the students. They wrote to me at the end of the year to tell me about important breakthroughs or things they had learned, sometimes from themselves, in the course of these writing meditations.</p>
<h2>Mindfulness and Mathematics</h2>
<p><em>How did you connect mindfulness with math in your teaching?</em></p>
<p>Connecting mindfulness with math was initially quite a challenge because math focuses on analyzing and getting answers. It’s oriented towards an endpoint. Mindfulness, on the other hand,  is about being present in the moment to whatever is there. What was important to me at this point in my teaching was that students learn how to sit with a problem even though they didn’t have an answer for it or even have a method to solve it – just sit with it without feeling they were going to be penalized if they didn’t end up with an answer.</p>
<p>In fact, I would sometimes ask them, “What questions do you have as you look at this problem – what comes to your mind?” I wanted them to learn to reflect, to see that they could just sit with something and have questions occur to them. This was not an easy transition for students used to coming up with answers but unfamiliar with coming up with questions.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that I was much more successful in my math classes at giving students a way to understand themselves better, even if they didn’t understand mathematics a lot better right away. We did five minutes of mindfulness practice before starting our work. My students would then work in groups of four. The focus they had while working with each other, the attention they paid, and the group discussions were more productive as a result of their having had a chance to settle in and get out on paper things that were bothering them as they left their last class or an interaction in the hall.</p>
<p>Before taking tests, I invited students to do five minutes of meditation. The first half of the meditation focused on how you were feeling and what you were thinking as you went into the test. As there may have been a number of students who were not feeling comfortable or confident, I wanted to give them the message that there was nothing wrong with those feelings. They were completely understandable in light of the amount of studying they’d done or how they did on their last test. My message was, “It’s okay; it’s not something that needs to take over your life for the next 45 minutes.”</p>
<p>Next we would turn our attention to something mathematical we had done in our life that we felt proud of or happy about. It might be when we learned to count to 10, solved a hard problem, or finally understood a difficult concept. We closed our eyes, and sat with that feeling, knowing that we have in us many positive experiences with math which are there even if we also have feelings of concern right now. If during the test they reached a point where they started to blank out or something similar, I asked them to just close their eyes and go back to that moment that they had thought of earlier when they felt very happy with mathematics and their relationship to it.*</p>
<h2>The Aspiration to Help Teachers</h2>
<p><em>What is your aspiration in sharing mindfulness with educators, especially in this wonderful new book? What are you hoping educators will come away with from a retreat or from reading this book?</em></p>
<p>At my high school I was in the position of being the only teacher with a mindfulness practice who found skillful ways of sharing mindfulness with students. I now see that the most important ways I shared mindfulness with my students were the changes in my own approach to teaching. The fact was, I now took my time, and I  asked students to take their time with what they were doing.</p>
<p>Eventually I began courses by giving students five minutes to eat a single raisin. We talked about how to eat the raisin and bring our full awareness to what was happening. I suggested that was how I wanted them to do their homework, not to rush through it in order to finish the assignment, but to spend 30-40 minutes on their homework even if they didn’t finish it. The way they did it was more important than how much they did.</p>
<p>In writing my book, I wanted to give teachers a sense of their own agency in choosing  what they conveyed to students. I did this by telling stories about how I grew as a teacher. While these stories were particular to me, each one is followed by three or four questions for readers to contemplate and reflect on. My hope for the book is that teachers will begin to spend more time reflecting on their own lives. My goal isn’t to tell teachers what to do when they get to their classroom. It’s to encourage them to develop their own mindfulness practice. Once teachers experience mindfulness and begin to really feel at home with it and ready to share it, they’ll find ways to do so that are organic and that work for their students.</p>
<p>I recently wrote an exercise called “free at work.” It was for anyone who works, and for teachers in particular, to help them meditate on their experience of working and their experience of freedom or lack of freedom and begin to see that most of the barriers to feeling free at work are internal barriers. If teachers start to practice in a way which enables them to have a different relationship with the so-called barriers inside of themselves, the kind of teaching they are doing will be greatly affected and likely become much more powerful. That’s what I want for teachers to get from the book.</p>
<h2>Connecting Teachers</h2>
<p>The Mindfulness in Education Network has over a thousand members all over the world. They’re focused on young people of different ages, on different subjects, on higher education, the arts, yoga etc., using all kinds of different approaches. As an early leader in this field, I would often get questions from other teachers asking me for advice on how to deal with a problem involving mindfulness. I could answer only a few of the questions from my own experience. When I knew I didn’t have a very helpful response for a particular question, I would invite the person who’d submitted it to me to go to the Mindfulness in Education Network website, join the listserv, and post their question. It was surprising and wonderful to see the wisdom that was available to answer the questions.</p>

            <h1 id="celebrating-life" class="chapter">Celebrating Life</h1>
            <div class="author">Sister Chân Diệu Nghiêm (Jina) &amp; Sister Chân Từ Nghiêm (Eleni)</div>
            <p><em>Sr. Dieu Nghiem (also known as Sr. Jina) arrived in Plum Village in 1990 as a monastic from the Japanese Soto Zen tradition. Sr. Jina was the abbess of Lower Hamlet from 1998 to 2014. Sr. Tu Nghiem (also known as Sr. Eleni) first came from America as a lay friend in 1990 and ordained in 1991.</br>
We asked these elders for some of their memories of the early days of Plum Village, and to share about the beginnings of the Plum Village basic practices, and about their lives in the fledgling community.</em></p>
<h2>Life in Community</h2>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Tu Nghiem</em>:</strong> It was such an eye-opening experience for me to [live in a Vietnamese community in rural France], coming from Manhattan – a city with big concrete apartment buildings. It was a totally different experience, and I appreciated so much the way the Vietnamese mothers and fathers, the children, were happy and harmonious together.</p>
<p>My parents were both children of immigrants, so they had the experience of speaking their parents’ native language and learning English later on, so maybe they transmitted to me a sense of feeling comfortable with other cultures. I was used to this double culture. The adjustments were not so difficult, and the Vietnamese culture I found was gentle and very respectful. I remember how Thay greeted the father of Br. Phap Ung. Thay stood up from the table, and when [Br. Phap Ung’s] father came into the room, Thay went up to him, (as he was older than Thay), and greeted him in the appropriate way. I was just so touched by Thay continuing to keep the value of addressing the parents of his disciples in a respectful way.</p>
<p>Thay always loved to hear Vietnamese songs, so after a dharma talk or before walking meditation he’d invite one of the brothers or sisters to come up and sing. Another time for singing together was after our meals. There were just two long tables where the whole sangha sat. Thay was at the head, Sr. Chan Khong next to him, and then the attendants. We ate our meal mindfully in silence, and then after the meal, it was time for singing and the plates were left on the table. It was really relaxed. Thay really encouraged music and singing as part of our monastic life.</p>
<p>As I look at the name  Plum Village, I see it was truly a Village. When I had the opportunity to go to Vietnam, I recognized that this is what a village is. Thay brought this way of living, the feeling of family, this spirit, to Plum Village. We called each other Su Chi (older sister) and Su Em (younger sister/brother) and Su Ong (father).</p>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Jina</em>:</strong> When I just arrived in Plum Village, everything seemed to be more or less organised. When there was working meditation there was a gathering and they said, “Oh the toilets need to be cleaned, who wants to clean the toilets? Yes, I’ll clean the toilets! The mediation hall needs to be set up…Yes!” Everybody just volunteered to do the work. I didn’t mind that it was not organised in every detail, I thought it was very nice to have this organic kind of feeling.</p>
<p>One of the things in Plum Village that I really appreciate is that whenever there is something to celebrate, we celebrate it. Even if we’ve never heard of that celebration before, but you have, you tell us what it is about and how we do it and we’ll do it. So I hope that we keep this Plum Village tradition. Thay was really encouraging that. Celebrate life! That’s why we have the Daffodil Festival, Plum Blossom Festival, Full Moon Festival, all those things.</p>
<h2>The Student-Teacher relationship</h2>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Tu Nghiem</em>:</strong> In the early days we were all beginners in the practice, brand new, one year to two years old. There was no mentoring. Thay had his room in Lower Hamlet and he would call people into his room. His attendant would say, “Thay wants to see you.” and you’d go into his room. So that’s how he would train us.</p>
<p>In those days he was training the abbess and abbot. They were called into Thay’s room, and the rest of us were left with freedom. Some were being trained to be his attendant, so they went into his room and learned to prepare tea. I have so much respect for Thay starting a monastic sangha with beginners. We were practically lay people, and Thay was teaching us how to be attendants, how to be abbots and abbesses. When Thay would learn about the difficulties in the sangha, he would give the next dharma talk based on those difficulties.</p>
<p>I was accepted, and for me that was enough. In the year 2001, I was able to be Thay’s attendant for one day at Deer Park [Monastery in the U.S.]. The experience was so funny! “You can be Thay’s attendant this evening” they told me. I had no training so they told me what to do carry Thay’s bag, where to place his shoes in the meditation hall etc. While attending Thay I left my shoes there in the mudroom during the dharma talk, but when it ended, Thay left by the opposite door. Thay left in his slippers, and I had to follow Thay in my bare feet! And then I think the brothers and sisters came to rescue me.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Jina</em>:</strong> I was very impressed by the calmness that Thay radiated. He was not in any way affected by whatever was happening around him. In the 21 Day Retreat it was all very organised and the Summer Retreat was very organic and Thay moved so naturally through both. I thought, this is very beautiful to see, in the midst of a very lively group of people, there was Thay, so naturally moving around, happy. So my first impression was of stability and clarity.</p>
<h2>Dharma talks</h2>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Tu Nghiem</em>:</strong> What is now the Lower Hamlet dining room was very small back then. Thay would come in and give the dharma talk. In the back of this room there was a ceramic divider, not completely to the ceiling but halfway, like a little wall, and then ceramic tiles. Behind this were stove burners to cook! So towards the end of Thay’s dharma talk we would <em>sniff, sniff,</em> smell that the sisters had started to cook. What was so beautiful about Thay in those days and our simple lives, was that it was natural.</p>
<p>We already had the chiming clock in the dining hall. It would chime every fifteen minutes. Thay would stop, we’d all breathe, and it was very peaceful. Then Thay would continue with the dharma talk. In those days it was Br. Nguyen Hai who was the cameraman. It’s amazing how they’ve preserved these early teachings. In those days Thay used a cassette recorder, and they’d have to stop and put in a new cassette and continue.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Jina</em>:</strong> Thay’s teachings were very clear. With certain teachings that one can say in a particular way, Thay just said, “This is it.” We listened to Thay, we tried to understand and even if we didn’t understand, it was just being in Thay’s presence. That was enough and I had already been so nourished by the 21 Day Retreat [after my arrival] I thought, I have at least three years material [to practice with].</p>
<p>[When the talks were in Vietnamese], Sr. Chan Khong used to translate and I enjoyed listening to Sr. Chan Khong very much because you also get side information, then you have a better context! It was very alive, I really enjoyed that.</p>
<p>In the 21 Day Retreat and the Summer Retreat, Thay was addressing a lot of issues what were happening in the sangha, like the lay sangha, the family issues, and also from the questions of the retreatants. During my first Winter Retreat I thought, oh now we really hear the scholar speaking, and that’s also what I was looking for. In the winter it was really study time.</p>
<h2>Care Packages for Vietnam</h2>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Tu Nghiem</em>:</strong> We wrapped care packages to send to Vietnam during the early days of the Hungry Children Program, in the early 1990s. We would go to the pharmacy and buy over-the-counter medicines like paracetamol or Tylenol, general medicines that did not need a prescription. We put them into little boxes with a letter. The letter would be written in a way like someone from Plum Village was writing to a friend in Vietnam. Our identity was never revealed because in those days you could not provide information to the government that it was coming from Thich Nhat Hanh or Plum Village. So these little care packages contained a beautiful letter, saying “I hope your family is well,” encouraging them to be creative and to receive the gift that we, as their friend, were offering. Now I learned that they would sell the medicines on the black market to buy rice. The care packages were sent very often, maybe every week. It was such an important part of the early history of Plum Village engaged Buddhism – to help Vietnam after the war, because there was a lot of poverty.</p>
<h2>Christmas</h2>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Tu Nghiem</em>:</strong> At Christmas we would go to the hermitage and gather in Thay’s library. There was a little Christmas tree on Thay’s table, and underneath there were a couple packages. When Thay received Christmas presents, he would open them very mindfully, and if it was a box of cookies or dried fruit, Thay would always share it with us. This was his practice, that he shared with the sangha. That really moved me, how he wanted to have all his children enjoy his gift.</p>
<p>Sometimes we were allowed to bring food to Thay on a tray. And once I remember Thay was cooking scrambled tofu for us. You know, it was so wonderful to see Thay cooking. He had on his winter sweater, a thick woolen sweater from Denmark, and Thay would be there at the stove cooking for all of us. It was so wonderful. So very caring for his disciples. I sat there in silence because I never knew what to say. At the table, Thay would share his food, and the plates were so small, just two three pieces of tofu. He would take one and then share it with everyone. I thought, how can he survive, taking such little food?</p>
<h2>Evolution of the Basic Plum Village Practices - Tea Meditation</h2>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Tu Nghiem</em>:</strong> In 1990-91, we lived in Lower Hamlet. Every Sunday afternoon, there would be a tea meditation [for everyone, lay and monastic] in the Red Candle Meditation Hall. Thay would come sometimes, Sr. Chan Khong, and during the years when Br. Giac Thanh was in Upper Hamlet, he would come and be the tea master. It was a very zen experience. Br. Giac Thanh would bring poems from the Vietnamese poets. It was a time for sharing poetry, a very creative time, very relaxed.</p>
<p>Br. Giac Thanh was, I believe, the master of relaxation. He spoke very slowly and gently. He read poetry with a lot of feeling and meaning, and then he would translate it into English if it was a Vietnamese poem. There was an opportunity to share songs. In those days we sang Vietnamese songs from the collection of Vietnamese songs in the book. There was also sharing about how we were doing.</p>
<h2>Continuing our Teacher and Reinventing the Practice</h2>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Tu Nghiem</em>:</strong> Something I valued so much in Thay and I want to continue is the path of the Bodhissatva Sadaparibhuta, which is always finding the best in people and letting them know they have these good qualities. Thay always believed in this. He once mentioned a sutra from the Buddha that says if someone has only one eye, you protect that one eye. That means the practitioner is weak but still has an aspiration. Protect that aspiration – don’t be so harsh. Thay always had so much compassion. His understanding was so immense.</p>
<p>People came with so-called mental illnesses and Thay would say let them stay and practice. No pressure was put on them. We just asked them to come to sitting if they could, or walking meditation, and eat with us. And they would stay around a week. I remember Thay said the collective energy of mindfulness, compassion, and kindness, and the culture of gentleness would help that person. That was Thay’s way in the early days of letting the sangha be a village where everyone could come and be here. I remember Thay's qualities of deep looking, great compassion and understanding, and always looking for the best in people, giving them a chance.</p>
<p>Now we have also become a training center for monastics. We’ve become the Institute of Higher Buddhist Studies and we are in a digital world. But I think it’s good to maintain the values of early Vietnam, the culture, the food, the poetry, Tet. There are brothers and sisters also interested in neuroscience, deep ecology, and that’s Thay’s engaged Buddhism. I think all of it can be part of Plum Village.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Jina</em>:</strong> Thay was always reinventing, renewing. Are we also renewing? Is there any practice that we think could be renewed? There may be some kind of practices that have lost their shine a little bit.</p>
<p>Thay was always practicing walking meditation, from the very beginning, even before there was a sangha. [I remember one day] I was attending Thay, in the sense that if Thay needed anything I would do it, Thay didn’t have an attendant as such. I would walk behind Thay from the meditation hall in the Upper Hamlet to Thay’s Hut to see if Thay needed anything, and Thay said something to me as we were walking and I just kept quiet. It was not a question but I didn’t give a counter remark or start a conversation or continue the conversation because I was walking and I thought well, we’re walking, why should I say something? And Thay stopped and said, “Do you want to stop while we’re talking?”, “Yes, Thay.” So we walked and then we talked in the hut, and from then on when you walked, you walked, when you wanted to talk, you stopped. That was a new practice that came in.</p>
<h2>Keeping the Essence of Plum Village</h2>
<p><strong><em>Sr. Tu Nghiem</em>:</strong> I think there are several levels and aspects [to this]. Thay wanted to create a monastic sangha, and an international fourfold sangha. So I think this is so important for the future of Plum Village, to keep the balance, that it remain international and fourfold – that means the nuns and laywomen and the monks and laymen are all part of the Plum Village community.</p>
<p>The essence of Plum Village is to continue to share the practices of mindfulness in as simple a form as possible, to meet the needs of people around the world, of different cultures, of different religions, and to present it in a way that’s understandable and acceptable by people anywhere. We keep the simplicity of the teachings, the basic teachings, four noble truths, eightfold path [and keep it accessible to the] beginners in the practice.</p>
<p>Also, we keep our tradition, we don’t dilute it. We keep the Vietnamese heritage, the lineage, the culture, to learn from. We want to learn from the beauty of Vietnamese culture, its gentleness, friendliness, and acceptance of newcomers. That’s what impressed me in the early days, the beauty of the flower arrangements, the tea meditations. And the western bands, the monastics with their drums, their electric guitars, we can have all that. I think it’s important because it reflects the world now.</p>

        </article><article class="article-returning-to-lower-hamlet">
            <h1 id="returning-to-lower-hamlet" class="chapter">Returning to Lower Hamlet</h1>
            <div class="author">Sister Chân Đức</div>
            <p>I arrived in Plum Village on the first of July 1986. A lay friend driving an old yellow Quatrelle picked me up at Sainte-Foy-La-Grande station. Three months earlier when Thay was in England at the invitation of myself and some friends at the Buddhist Peace Fellowship, he had suggested I come to Plum Village for a month. When I arrived in Upper Hamlet, Thay was sitting in a hammock, which was always slung between two trees opposite the <em>Stone Building</em>. He was wearing grey <em>ao vat ho</em><span class="note">Traditional Vietnamese short robes worn by monastic practitioners</span> because it was a very hot day.</p>
<p>When I joined my palms to greet Thay, he said: “Here is India. India is Here.” I did not understand and I thought Thay meant: “The weather is very hot here, like in India.” Later, on reflection, I realised Thay meant something like: “My child, this is your spiritual home. You do not need to go to India to find your home.” Thay told me later that this was a quotation from a poem by the Vietnamese meditation master Vô Ngôn Thông of the 9<sup>th</sup> Century<span class="note">Tây Thiên thử độ, thử độ Tây Thiên (<span lang="zh">西天此度，此度西天  - 無言通禪師</span>)</span>.</p>
<p>My first impression was how relaxed and relaxing the Upper Hamlet was. It was two weeks before the annual Summer Opening and preparations were being made in such a joyful and leisurely way. A bed had been prepared for me in a room whose name over the lintel was “Young Moon”. The bed consisted of four bricks, which supported at each corner a plank of conglomerate wood, covered by a thin piece of form. In the following days I helped prepare beds like that for the guests who were to come.</p>
<p>Another impression was: <em>This is a “five star hotel”</em>, because in the monastery where I had practised in India we had been so poor. We had no running water, no electricity, and no beds. Here I had the basic amenities as well as a spiritual family to practise with, and a teacher who spoke English and French and could guide me in the practice.</p>
<p>After a month, I was allowed to go to Lower Hamlet for the last two weeks of the Summer Opening. I stayed in the <em>Plum Hill</em> building, which had eight beds like the ones in the Upper Hamlet. I had a strange feeling of being at home when sitting under the centenarian oak trees and looking out to the North. The view was more expansive then because there was not yet the poplar tree grove. I experienced the same feeling when practising circumambulation in the <em>Red Candle Hall</em> and seeing the stones that made the walls. At that time, there was no plaster between the stones.</p>
<p>Around Lower Hamlet there was much more forest than there is now, and the 21 hectares that belonged to the hamlet had vineyards and many fruit trees. It was indeed a secret garden to explore. One day in the autumn in August, Thay picked blackberries and gave them to me, asking me to make jam. He must have known that my mother made bramble jelly every year so it was easy for me to continue her.</p>
<p>Sư mẹ asked to please keep this word
During the Summer Opening, by the side of the oak trees was the “Oak Tree Kiosk” selling all kinds of sweetmeats in the afternoon. The proceeds went to the poorest children in Vietnam. With this money, Sr. Chan Khong would buy medicine. We would put the medicine in boxes and send them to social workers in Vietnam. They would sell the medicine and give the money to those who needed it. We did not just send material things; every parcel also contained some exaltation to practise mindfulness.</p>
<p>After the Summer Opening, the guests went home and I moved into the <em>Cypress Building</em>. This building is now the kitchen, store, and dining room of the Lower Hamlet. At that time <em>Purple Cloud Building</em> was full of straw and dung left by the cattle that had inhabited it. The room I was given was quite large. It had a floor of baked tiles, a green porcelain wood stove, a chair, and a desk. I stayed there alone until Sr. Chan Vi arrived in May 1987.</p>
<p><em>Cypress Building</em> had an attic. There were many buckets and basins up there to catch the rain. When it rained hard, there were never enough buckets in the right place and the rain would come through the ceiling and sometimes on to my bed. Plum Village did not have the money to repair the roof at that time.</p>
<p>When I first came to the Lower Hamlet, there was a traditional brick bread oven. It was in a little stone building behind the <em>Purple Cloud</em>. It had been repaired by a Dutch O.I. member Robert Naeff, who had knowledge of building this kind of bread ovens, so we could actually make bread. You made a wood fire in the oven and when the wood began to turn into embers, you took them out and put them in a bucket. You had to be very careful doing this because if they fell onto the surrounding dry grass, it could cause a fire. Then you placed the uncooked bread in the heated oven. We had to try a few times in order not to burn the bread, but eventually we succeeded in making something edible.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful neighbour who lived in what is now the <em>Cherry House</em>. Monsieur Mounet made apple tarts and took them to the markets to sell. He had constructed his own gas-fired oven and he said after he had finished baking the tarts, the oven was still hot enough to bake bread, so I would bring my bread and bake it in his oven, which was much simpler.</p>
<p>For Thay, music and poetry were an important part of the practice. We did not have any English practice songs when I first came to Plum Village. Thay encouraged all his students to write Dharma songs. At first we thought we could never write a song but somehow Thay managed to water that seed in us. The first song I wrote was before I ordained as a nun. It came to me as I was washing dishes in the small, low sink that we had in the kitchen of Cypress Building. It was “Breathe and you know that you are alive”. Thay had been teaching the <em>Anapanasatti Sutta</em>. When I look at this song, I see that Thay must have taught this sutta in a very colourful and poetic way and I had already heard about <em>Great Master Bamboo Forest (Truc Lam Dai Si)</em> of the 13h Century who told his disciple: <em>“Whenever I pick something up, it is always new”</em>, and that’s what gave rise to the last line of the song.</p>
<p>In 1990 after the ordination of Brother Nguyen Hai, Brother Phap Dang, and Brother Vo Ngai, Thay told me to go and live in Upper Hamlet to keep an eye on the practice up there as there were no other elder monks yet. Although I had two younger blood brothers, I was a real novice in taking care of young monks. I considered my task was to make sure they came to the sitting. There were also a couple of novice monks from a temple in the US. I think there were five novices in all. Two of them were compliant to my wishes, the other three thought it very strange to have a nun telling them what to do. One said it was like being in the army with me as the colonel! One day in frustration at the novices’ absence in the morning sitting, I entered the room of one of them and pulled back the sleeping bag from the sleeping monk. This is probably where my reputation for being an army colonel came from. Thay had recently introduced the practice of Beginning Anew, so we had to do it. One young brother told me that I needed to understand that he had stomach problems and that is why he did not come to the meditation.</p>
<p>When I came to Upper Hamlet, I was inexperienced in building sangha as a family. Maybe because of my training as a schoolteacher, I was only aware of myself in relationship to the brothers as the one who had to remind them to practise. I was translating <em>History of Vietnamese Buddhism</em> at the time. Any free time, I spent upstairs in the <em>Stone Building</em> doing this, rather than devoting myself to making a family atmosphere. I still had much to learn in how to be a good elder sister. This has been a learning process throughout my monastic life.</p>
<p>In 1991, fortunately Thay Giac Thanh arrived and I could be relieved of my Upper Hamlet duties.</p>
<p>In my 33 years as a nun, I have certainly had challenges to face. What helps me most is my deep trust in the Dharma as the teachings of truth, and in Thay as the one who can transmit them to me. <strong>As the years have passed, my trust in the compassion and wisdom of the sangha has grown and this place of refuge always helped in difficult moments.</strong></p>
<p>Sister Chan Khong, my elder Dharma sister, has been a stable and compassionate guide for me. When I first lived in Plum Village, my practice was to nourish the seeds of happiness. Sister Chan Khong was a very good example of someone who had been through so much and who could find so much happiness in little things in the present moment. I learnt more from her examples than from her advice. One thing that was very helpful for me was reminding me to smile every half hour. I had to keep an eye on the clock, but I really wanted to be able to do that. Sister Chan Khong has taught me in difficult moments to be aware of all the things I have to be grateful for, right here and right now, and how to practise mere recognition in order to take care of unwholesome mental formations.</p>
<p>Now when Thay is no longer there in Plum Village, my trust in the sangha has deepened. Over the years I have seen how compassionate the sangha is. When dealing with a sister who has difficulties, rather than punishing and blaming, the sangha tried to embrace that sister. The sangha's growth in compassion is thanks to the advice and guidance of Thay. Of course there are times when the sangha has to lay down firm guidelines, but that is done out of love. I also see how the sangha has the capacity to listen deeply to each other in a way that thirty years ago would not have been possible.</p>
<p>We certainly have our ups and downs but we can sit together, begin anew, and go ahead understanding each other more deeply. Very often it has been the difficulties that have emptied me of pride and self-confidence, and filled me with <em>non-self</em> confidence. This is how I understand “<em>the kleśa are the bodhi,</em> <em>the afflictions are the awakening</em>”.</p>
<p>Some of the important moments of revelation seem to occur when I am sitting in a circle with other practitioners. I suddenly realize that I do not have a separate self and I can only be in relationship to others. When I first come into a circle, I usually arrive early and watch sisters coming in. As we become settled, I like to look around and feel my affection for each sister who is sitting there. I follow my breathing as I am doing this. I know that we all come from very different backgrounds and on the surface we all look and behave very differently. Nevertheless there is something very deep that connects us. It is rather like the trees in the forest where the roots of one are always connected to the roots of others. The simple fact that we live together twenty-four hours a day, and we all have made the same commitment to the monastic life seems to bond us in a special way.</p>
<p>Since I came to Plum Village, I have transformed but I recognize I still have so many shortcomings. No one wants to do harm. But I can unwittingly say something, which causes trouble. I have to forgive myself because I did not know what I was doing. However, at the same time, I have to make a strong resolve to do better. When I first came to Plum Village I found it difficult to listen to someone pointing out my faults. I think I am better at doing this now. In the beginning I had trusted Thay more than in the sangha. I have much more trust in the sangha now and I am able to see Thay is in fact the sangha because the sangha is the masterpiece of Thay.</p>
<p>My fear of death has lessened and the teachings on the cloud have helped me. I remember when I was living in the <em>Green Mountain Dharma Centre</em>; we had so much snow in the winter. One of the things we liked to do was to lie on the snow, stretch out our arms, and then move them back and forth. Then we would stand up and look at the image impressed on the snow – it was exactly like an angel. As I lay in the snow, I would see how the water in my own body and the water outside in the form of snow were not two separate things. This meditation on the six elements inside my body and outside my body helps me to see that I am not able to die in the sense of becoming non-existent. In fact there is no “I” anyway to die. In France where we do not often have snow, I see myself in the cloud and the cloud in me.</p>
<p>I have been in Lower Hamlet for about twelve months now. I left Lower Hamlet in 1996 to go to New Hamlet and then to Maple Forest, so I was absent from Lower Hamlet for 24 years. There are places that have not changed very much, like the little path that leads down to what was my hut, the path behind the Dharma Nectar Hall, the Red Candle Hall, and the grand oak trees. Thay’s room in the Lower Hamlet where Thay would lie in the hammock after the Dharma Talk and invite us to drink tea with him is one place where we can feel Thay’s presence very clearly. As soon as I practise mindful walking in the Lower Hamlet, the flavour of Plum Village thirty or more years ago is very apparent.</p>
<p>I remember one time in the Lower Hamlet when I was a layperson and we were preparing to get in the car to go to visit <em>Fleurs de Cactus</em> in Paris. I had a deep aspiration to walk just like Thay walked, so I tried it out for myself while waiting for others to arrive. Maybe at the time it was more outer form than content, but over the years, the peace and joy that come from walking like this are authentic. Thay’s steps in Plum Village are what have made the atmosphere of Plum Village sacred, and of course we all want to keep this sacred atmosphere alive by continuing to walk mindfully.</p>
<h2>Letter to Thay, October 2021</h2>
<p>Beloved and respected Thay,</p>
<p>Last night at about 04.00 am I had a dream. Our international monastic sangha had gathered at a train station. Hundreds of us were all there together. Sister Tu Nghiem (sister Eleni) and I for some reason did not have a ticket. I felt it was urgent that we buy a ticket without delay. We went to the ticket office but it was closed. Then the man who sold tickets appeared. He was very kind and agreed to sell us tickets immediately. I worried that I did not have any money but the man said he wanted to give us a ticket for two for the price of a ticket for one. I had exactly the right amount of money. With our tickets we went outside to join the sangha which was going up the steps to the train together. On seeing the sangha i could not believe how beautiful it was: even more beautiful than the wild-goose sangha that migrates over France in the autumn and spring in a stunning V formation.</p>
<p>When I woke up I thought, “I have seen Thay. The sangha is Thay; Thay’s lifetime creation.”</p>
<p>I remembered the times I accompanied Thay on tours to China or Korea. We visited ancient monasteries with old attic libraries full of wood blocks from which the sutras were printed. On two separate occasions Thay had pointed out to me the gatha from the Vajracchedika Sutra:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone who looks for me in form<br/>
Or seeks me in sound<br/>
Is caught in an abstraction<br/>
And will not find me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For many years I have been caught in that abstraction, that misapprehension. This morning I have seen a much greater Thay.</p>
<p>Sometimes as an elder sister I need to be a teacher for my younger siblings. I need to practice signlessness in looking at them too and realise that Thay is in each of them.</p>
<p>Touching the earth in boundless gratitude,</p>
<p>your child chan duc.</p>

            <div class="author">Sister Chân Giác Nghiêm</div>
            <p>Thinking of Plum Village in its early days is like opening a sacred and wonderful book where Peace and Happiness walk hand in hand.</p>
<p>Let's imagine a path in the countryside bordered on the right by oak trees with thick trunks, looking like large legs, or as Thay would have said, like a herd of elephants welcoming us. On the left, the path leads to a very large field where there is a farm. A young linden tree stands near the entrance to the buildings. A large barn miraculously becomes a meditation hall.</p>
<p>The building that follows shelters our Teacher: Thay on the first floor and his children below, sharing the premises. The entrance opens into a small living room, furnished soberly, with a fireplace. This is where Thay will welcome me for our first meeting in Plum Village..</p>
<p>Facing the staircase leading upstairs, is an alcove enclosed by a curtain, with very simple beds. The place is offering me some rest: four bricks high, a wooden plank for the bed base, a yoga mat, a small pillow, and a light blanket; I cannot find words to express the joy I feel when I see this great simplicity. On each side of the entrance, two rooms protect the numerous and joyful Vietnamese families. The laughter of children delights our hearts.</p>
<p>Just opposite the entrance another stone building conceals the heart of the community: the living room (<em>&quot;salle à vivre&quot;</em>), which simultaneously serves as a dining room, kitchen, and meeting place.vThis is where our dear Thay prepares tea with great simplicity that he then offers to us with a gesture of great gentleness. Thay is true, Thay is Love.</p>
<p>At the end of the room, a door opens into a small meditation room where a fireplace serves as an altar. Here the whole community gathers to meditate. There, all is happiness. Another door opens onto a vast field with a white cloud of wild carrot flowers interwoven with the sky-blue flowers of chicory, just like the Milky Way. I secretly think: “God has laid his finger on this precious earth. I have arrived, I am home.” Thay is there, his attentive presence pervades the garden, Thay removes the wilted flowers at the end of each day, and waters the plants with care.</p>
<p>On arrival, I met Thay and Sister Cao Fleurette in the garden. This was in 1985. Sister Fleurette had long hair and beautiful eyes and a deep, compassionate look. Since then, I have been growing slowly next to these two wonderful trees.</p>
<p>It was a reunion. I had the joy of meeting them a few months earlier in Lyon, at the home of Dr. Do Trong Le, an acupuncturist friend who invited me to come to his house to listen to the first teaching that our Teacher was giving in French. At that time I was desperately looking for a Teacher to help me on my spiritual path. A profound encounter took place during the teaching when Thay held a sheet of white paper in front of him and said, “In this sheet of paper lies the whole universe.” I was filled with joy, I had found the Teacher I was looking for, the one who could understand me. The Dharma Door was wide open.</p>
<p>When I reread <em>'Old Path White Clouds'</em> , I always feel great emotion when Thay writes about Sujata searching for the Buddha in the early morning, and the moment they meet each other…</p>
<p>My spiritual life resumed its course in peace.</p>
<p>One day during this first retreat, I did not participate in the walking meditation around Upper Hamlet. Instead, I sat under the linden tree to write. At the end of the walking meditation, Thay approached me gently and asked me in a friendly manner:</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Sister Elisabeth?”</p>
<p>“Dear Thay, since I met you, I have been applying your teachings in the hospital where I work with my patients. I have a very busy life and I don't have time to write about these practices, so today I have chosen to take the time to write about them. Please forgive me.”</p>
<p>“Carry on”, said our Teacher, “and offer me your work.”</p>
<p>From then on, all the mindfulness practices I applied while working in the hospital were written down and offered to Thay as well as to the head of the department of the hospital where I was practising. Seeing the results with the patients, he generously gave me 'carte blanche' to practise mindfulness! It was in 1985. Such happiness!</p>
<p>Every day we had some working meditation with the Sangha. At that time, Thay printed his teachings and then placed the sheets of the future book on a table. With mindfulness, we walked slowly around the table, collecting the sheets one by one, following our breathing and our steps, before placing at the end of the table the reunited sheets awaiting to be turned into a book. Then we started again, with smiling faces, to give birth to the next book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With one step I breathe in, I take a sheet of paper,<br/>
With one step I breathe out, I smile.<br/>
With one step I breathe in, a book will be born<br/>
With one step I breathe out, I smile. …”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an amazing experience from my early practice. I really enjoyed working meditation with the community. Everyone participated, including Thay. One morning a young woman came up to me and asked me to cut some bread “in mindfulness”, she added seriously.</p>
<p>“I breathe in, here's the bread, I breathe out (Heavens, how do you cut bread in mindfulness?), no breathe out…”</p>
<p>Huge doubts arose in me… With this on-going question : '<em>What does it mean to cut bread in mindfulness</em>?' The lady came back a while later, nothing had happened… She kindly liberated me from my frozen state of mind. When the intellect dominates, doubt appears…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plum Village is full of fond memories.<br/>
Teaching<br/>
Sitting in Peace,<br/>
At the feet of Thây,<br/>
In the shade of the great venerable oaks<br/>
In Lower Hamlet.<br/>
Brown heads, blond heads,<br/>
Turned towards its light,<br/>
The Nectar of Dharma<br/>
Trickles down.</p>

            <div class="author">Sister Chân Hoa Nghiêm</div>
            <p>Plum Village, in the 1980s and 1990s was like a rural village, still very rustic. There were very few people there and life was quite simple. Our room only had a table and a bed. The bed was nothing but a plank of wood on top of four bricks. On my ordination day, my elder sister, Sister Doan Nghiem, offered me a set of faded brown short robes. I also received a top from Sister Vien Quang and a pair of pants from Sister Chan Vi so I could have another complete set of short robes. Thay also gave me one grey long robe, which I liked very much. At that time, I was only half my current age. I was young and full of spirit. I was quite active and eager to do everything. I volunteered to work in the garden because our food was very basic then and we ate what we planted in the garden. But I was born and grew up in the city so gardening was something very new to me. I followed Sister Chan Vi to learn how to garden. We were so keen on digging the soil that we even skipped evening sitting meditation sessions. Sister Chan Vi and I were scolded by Sister Thanh Luong: “You are here to practice, not to work!” We immediately went to her to begin anew because she was our eldest sister at the time.</p>
<p>When the seeds of the pumpkins and tomatoes germinated, I was besotted with the baby plants, and watched them grow every day. On lazy days, my elder sister, Sister Bao Nghiem woke me up at 6 a.m. so that I could go with her and sister Chan Vi to the garden to catch slugs. Like snails, slugs really like to eat young pumpkin, squash or vegetable plants. It only took a slug one morning to chew up a young pumpkin plant, negating all our hard work of two Spring months to sow the seeds and water the plants. In one morning like that we could fill up a whole jar with slugs. Sister Chan Vi looked at me, smiling, “Hoa Nghiem, now we bring them to a new economic-zone.” I looked back at her, surprised, “Where would that new economic-zone be?” She laughed out loud, “We will bring them to the woods. There they don’t have vegetables to eat, they will eat only grass.” I realized then what she meant. I reckoned it was better that they ate grass instead of being killed. There were gardeners who sprayed pesticides on the young plants and vegetables. Without knowing it, slugs ate the sprayed plants and burst their bellies and died. Thay often told us that we could share half of the vegetables with the slugs and we eat only half rather than killing them as it would be too painful to do so. Compassion taught us to love all species, all living beings.</p>
<p>When Thay was not away for teaching tours in the US, we were very happy. In those days, Thay often came to Lower Hamlet and taught us the monastic Mindful Manners. Things like, when sweeping the floor, we should not raise the broom too high because doing so would stir up the dust everywhere. Or when eating, we should keep our head straight up and not bent over etc. Thay also taught us how to write poetry. Ms. Tinh Thuy and Brother Vo Ngai were the quickest learners among us. Soon after Thay finished his teaching, they already submitted their newly composed poems. Thay then taught us how to edit their poems to make them rhyme better. Each time Thay came back to Lower Hamlet, we were so happy as if in a festival. These sweet, beautiful memories, they are endless! All of them have nourished my bodhicitta until now.</p>
<p>During the Summer Retreats, so many people came to practice. In the old days, Lower Hamlet was reserved for Vietnamese practitioners. In the first Summer Retreat I joined as a novice nun, my responsibility was to help Sister Chan Khong to organize tea meditation sessions. I checked the registration list and made invitation letters for the tea sessions, and then prepared tea cups and took care of the work of the tea attendant. I did this for the whole Summer Retreat. Besides that, I also helped Ms. Tinh Thuy in the bookshop and joined the cooking team with Thanh Tuyen (now Sr. Huong Nghiem). Having just ordained, how could I know how to cook for that many people? At that time we hosted 60, 70 or even 100 lay friends each week. Before the Summer Retreat, Sister Thanh Luong already trained us in cooking. Which pot should we use to cook for 50 to 100 people? How many knives and cutting boards should we prepare for lay friends to help us cut vegetables during mindful service time? Thanh Tuyen and I were on the same team. We discussed, and planned that we would cook the same dishes every week. We thought that each week new friends would come and no one would know! Only the sisters complained. Sister Chan Vi said, “Every time you two cook, you do the same old thing. Don’t you get bored?” I replied quietly in my head, “Only once a week, how could anyone get bored?” I don’t really remember what dishes they were but I still remember my favorite dish, which was black bean porridge topped with coconut milk and salted roasted-peanuts for the evening meal. I cooked that every week when it was my turn.</p>
<p>There were weeks when many Vietnamese people came. Thanh Tuyen arranged for the aunties (the elder women) to stay in my room. I once shared the room with seven of them. I was quite happy. Sharing the room with them I could listen to their stories about their families and children. I felt very fortunate that I took this path; otherwise I would have suffered as much as they did at the time.</p>
<p>In a little forest near Lower Hamlet there was a long lake with crystal-clear water. The trees in the forest were very beautiful; their branches leaning on one another just like us in the Ssangha. After the Ssummer Rretreat we would normally have a 10-day lazy period. On these lazy days I often packed amy little sac with a piece of bread, a banana, and a thermos filled with hot water. Walking into the woods, I would find a clearing to spread out my sitting mat. I practiced sitting meditation and then ate my lunch there. After that I took a long nap until the afternoon set in, then I cleaned up and went back to the hamlet. My novice nun experience inof the old days was really pure, only practice, nothing else.</p>
<p>In the old days of Plum Village, we only interacted with lay friends who came to practice with us. When they came here they only focused on the practice and followed the schedule. That was why we had very limited contact with the outside world. News of the world about politics or incidents of violence etc. have never once appeared in my mind, let alone my imagining or thinking of them. Each month we received a modest amount of pocket money that was enough to buy personal hygiene items, or a notebook to write down the teachings from Thay, or sometimes a box of LU biscuits, which would be saved for moments of sweet craving. The word “donation” was really foreign and new to me. After so many years staying in Plum Village, I only received a donation one time and the amount was equivalent to 5 or 10 dollars. I always said to myself,: “I didn’t becomebecame a monastic not to receivelook for donations.” Thay taught us in a monastic retreat: The purpose of a monastic is not food and clothing. It is also not to look for material comfort. The practice of Plum Village is to generate happiness.</p>
<p>In the old days when there was no Internet, or iPhones, iPads, computers etc., communication through technology was limited and people did not have manymuch fearsfear or worries. Today however, the more modern and more expansive the communication, the more people like to amass information. Most of the time however, this information brings us worryies and sufferings. Our lives become so busy without a moment of peace.</p>
<p>I still recall the day we celebrated 20 years of Plum Village. When Plum Village was 20 years old, we were a little older in the Dharma and had already received the lamp transmission. At that time, we were like young birds trained to fly from their warm nest.  Thay assigned us with the task of going out to building Plum Village practice centers in Europe, America and Asia.</p>
<p>Now Plum Village is 40 years old and we are also becoming middle aged. Though the phenomenaon of birth and death, of change, are in the historical dimension, it is still time to prepare a place to return to. I always remind myself of that. My younger sister, Sister. Chỉ Nghiêm however, was already ahead of me.</p>
<p>This morning, after many months of battling with cancer, Sisterr. Chỉ Nghiêm waved her last goodbye to the Ssangha amidst the sound of our evoking the Buddha’s names. Conditions have ceased in this lifetime and when they converge again, she will manifest in a new, even more beautiful life.</p>
<p>When Deer Park monastery was founded, Sisterr. Chỉ Nghiêm followed Thay’s instruction to go there first and build it with other sisters. When Blue Cliff was founded, she also volunteered to come here to support building the new Ssangha. She had never let down Thay and the ancestral teachers. In her last moments, she was at peace. Last night in the Purification Ceremony, Venerable Minh Tuan brought a dark yellow paper fan on which was painted a Zen circle with Thay’s calligraphy in it: “My child, smile as you cross to the other shore.”</p>
<p>Walking on the path to the Great Togetherness meditation hall, I saw the monks' residence alight with beautiful colors. Christmas has arrived. My sisters have also turned on decorative lights in our quarters to celebrate Christmas. It feels so alive and joyful as if there had never been a funeral just a few days ago. The light and shade of time!</p>
<p>It seems like only yesterday that I saw Thay sitting on the podium teaching. It seems like only yesterday that I saw myself helping Thay putting down fertilizer for the chrysanthemums. It seems like only yesterday that I saw myself together with athe delegation walking behind Thay, ascending the Vulture Peak within mindful steps… All of that seems like a beautiful dream now. I have to accept the change in order to touch the unchangeable, which isare the love between Thay and his disciples, brotherhood, and sisterhood and, bodhicitta. These will stay dear in my heart forever, in this life and for many lives to come.</p>

            <h1 id="advent-preserving-a-beautiful-tradition" class="chapter">Advent - Preserving a Beautiful Tradition</h1>
            <div class="author">Sister Chân Trăng Bồ Đề</div>
            <p>When I was little, at Christmas time all the streets were strewn with twinkling lights and Christmas trees - plastic, but beautiful. The quiet church near my home came alive with joy. Even though I didn’t know about Christmas, I was still very happy because I could wander the streets at night, looking at this and that. I never had the courage to step foot in a church, except for one time when curiosity got the better of me, and the only reason was: I am a Buddhist. There seemed to be a line dividing church and temple. My parents and grandparents all agreed that a Buddhist should not go to a church. It would be an act of impiety. So that idea was firmly planted in the heads of all the children in my family.</p>
<p>When I came to Diệu Trạm Temple, I had more chances to enjoy the Christmas spirit. From decorating the meditation hall, practising performances, preparing <em>“Secret Santa”</em> gifts… to the moment when all my roommates gathered to unwrap gifts; it was so joyful, lively, and warm. I wondered why we celebrated Christmas in the temple. The idea sown in me as a child was still there and as far as I know, we were the only temple that celebrated Christmas. I asked my older sister about it. She replied that it was a way of integrating cultures.</p>
<p>Christmas in the west is as significant as the Lunar New Year in the east. It is an occasion for families to gather, offer mutual words of appreciation as well as send their peaceful prayers to the world. “Later when you go to Plum Village France or other centres in the west, you will see the Christmas spirit clearer.” “The Christmas spirit?“ I was a little confused. But my heart was already full of joy because I received many gifts, so I did not ask any more.</p>
<p>My impression of Christmas at that time was only of  joy and liveliness. It wasn't until I came to Plum Village France, saw the lighting of candles during Formal Lunch and listened to the Christmas carols that I came in touch with another aspect of the Christmas spirit, one that is tranquil and peaceful. I also learned a new term: <em>Advent</em>, something completely foreign to me because it had never been organised in Diệu Trạm.</p>
<p>I did not attend Advent in my first two years as I felt it was not suited to me. This year, I gave myself an opportunity to experience it directly. One big motivation for me was that the event was held at <em>Toad Skin Hut</em> (in Son Ha Temple), a place I rarely have a chance to go. I do not know why but in my heart there is a strange love for this place. Just thinking about going there already made me happy. As I sat in the hut, feeling the warmth from the fireplace and listening to the conversations and laughter of brothers and sisters around me, I came back to myself.</p>
<p>Coming back to myself, the sound of chatter around me became pleasant. Sometimes absolute silence does not come from sitting meditation… Even amidst hustle and bustle, when we know how to come back to ourselves, it is the place where we can be in touch with our true self. Darkness had started its roaming. Looking out, I could see nothing but windblown raindrops against the window. Night had descended. Night is where the darkest evil can arise, but also where the most sacred and pure are born. Night can be a vehicle to bring people straight to hell, or give wings for prayers to reach the stars. At that moment, everyone sang and lit the second candle of Advent.</p>
<p>The Christmas carols became more solemn in the silence of the night, opening the way for all to return to the deepest beauty of the soul. Closing my eyes, I relaxed to let the refreshing sound sink forever into my heart. Amidst that peace, it was as if every unwholesome thought had to dissolve. People's hearts became as clear as the morning dew, as holy as the baby Jesus. The candlelight flickered and danced, carrying afar the prayers of the brothers and sisters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I pray for peace for all the victims of Covid in Vietnam and around the world.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wish safety for the Afghanistan refugees that are suffering due to war.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following suit, I joined my palms, introduced my name and spoke out the wish in my heart: <em>“I wish for those who are displaced to be able to return home and enjoy moments of happiness just like our's now.”</em></p>
<p>After some moments of silence, the brothers and sisters began to recount joyful memories of Christmas. Almost everyone had more or less memories related to a character called <em>Father Christmas</em>. Listening is a chance for me to see more clearly the face of my siblings and to know a little more about those we rarely speak with. Living in a large sangha, connection is often no more than stopping to join palms in greeting, smile, and then pass by. Most opportunities for communication and interactions are through a bridge called <em>work</em>. Even with the elder and younger sisters I am living with, sometimes I am surprised to realize that I have never really looked carefully at their faces or been truly present for them. I am merely recognizing and distinguishing my sisters by their names.</p>
<p>After living for a while in the monastery, I also started to love a tranquil and peaceful life. That tranquility helps me see my mind clearer and nourishes my inner peace. But when I start to form the thought, “I like the quiet, noise is too tiring”, a wall goes up between the world and I, limiting the precious opportunities to be with my brothers and sisters. At those times when I find myself “too lazy to play”, I often think of our elder Brother Minh Hy.</p>
<p>Brother Minh Hy is very playful. He is always present with an open and friendly heart. That evening when he arrived in the rain, I couldn't contain my surprise: “Brother, you also come to Advent?” “Sure!” he replied, as naturally as the hungry eat and the thirsty drink. The image that lingers in my mind is of Br. Minh Hy holding a songbook; his mouth uttering the melody and lyrics while his eyes struggled to open to stay awake. “Brother, are you sleepy?” Catching my cheeky smile, rather than answering, he pretended to open his eyes even wider. At that moment, I understood: <em>“To play without needing to play is truly to play…”</em></p>
<p>My first impression of Advent was so beautiful that when a sister asked me: “How was your first Advent?” Without hesitation I replied: “Fun and nourishing!” “Will you go again?” “Yes, for sure”, I nodded firmly.</p>
<p>This first experience helped me unravel my preconceptions about the event, and taught me a lesson about being cautious with my perceptions. If I do not know something, do not rush to judge it. Give myself  time to experience it, to discover the reality. An event itself is indeterminate. It is those who attend and organize the event that gives it its colours. Advent is beautiful because of its spiritual elements. We brothers and sisters must preserve those elements if we wish to preserve the beauty and soul of Advent. But what are those spiritual elements and how do we preserve them?</p>
<p>The cloud in the tea I drank this morning reminds me that the most accurate answer does not come from the intellect, or from the outside; it comes from the heart of everyone.</p>
<p>While listening quietly to the Bible reading that evening, images of Jesus as a baby or bearing the cross, which I had seen since childhood floated to my mind's surface. Every image was beautiful. The lines on his face were as gentle as the lines sculptors often use to express the Buddha's boundless love. Buddha is beautiful and Jesus is beautiful. You are udumbara flowers that bloomed in the darkness of humanity. In that moment, I felt I had finally broken free from a narrow cage that has held so many generations captive. I am freeing my grandparents and parents from the idea of being a “Buddhist”. I am stretching my wings to soar higher and further in the vast sky of the mind.</p>
<p>Thinking of Thầy my heart warms. Thầy opened the door for Buddhism’s essence to enter the west and at the same time, allowed Buddhists to discover the beauty of spiritual traditions in the west. Thanks to Thầy, our generation is receiving a rich heritage of various spiritual flows - each beautiful, each worthy of respect.</p>
<p>It was almost nine o'clock. “Dear sister, it's time to go home”, I whispered to my elder sister. “Umm, we will go after this song.” A funny thought popped up in my mind: <em>Why are we like Cinderellas?</em> The New Hamlet always leaves a little earlier than the other hamlets because we live a little further. If one sister stands up, all of us gather our things, say goodbye in unison and head out for the van as if it would turn into a pumpkin if we do not return in time. Gradually I have also adapted to the rhythm and am trained in those agile movements. It's quite fun being Cinderella. Knowing that I do not have much time, I cherish every moment and am wholeheartedly present. So when “it's time to go” was said, I stood up and stepped out calmly. For me, what is important is <em><strong>not how long</strong></em> we are present, but <em><strong>how</strong></em> we are present.</p>
<p>The van rapidly rolled home. I secretly hoped that next year more Cinderellas from New Hamlet would attend Advent. Together, let us preserve this beautiful tradition for future generations of sisters and brothers.</p>

            <div class="author">Sister Chân Trăng Hiền Nhân</div>
            <p>Dear respected Thầy, dear noble Sangha,</p>
<p>This year, as we are celebrating 40 years of Plum Village, I am just turning 3 years old as a monastic. I am like a tiny tree just learning to absorb the warmth and the light of the sun, and Plum Village is the great forest in whichwhere I gently grow. This past year, we have adorned Lower Hamlet with several new jewels, as if beautifying her for athis great celebration of a special birthday.</p>
<p>We planted 150 trees, made a new, vast and spacious walking path, moved the Happy Farm, and what used to be a parking lot in front of the Big Meditation Hall is now an inviting garden, protected by the shade of the pPoplar tTrees withand their gentle songs in the wind, colorful with many flowers, and tender with newly planted trees. At the same time, we also enjoy in their full growth, the many treasures offered by Thầy and the Sangha from the past 40 years: The cCathedral of the pPoplar fForest, the lLotus pPond, the pPlum oOrchard, and all the many trees planted along the paths and on the grass amidstong flowers.</p>
<p>Thus, old and new stand together in harmony, complete each other in beauty and strength. When the Sangha practices walking meditation in the pPpoplaroplar grove and the small forest sanctuary where Thầy loved so much to take us, I feel like we are walking in Thầy’s steps and continuing the old path with a faithful and determined heart. When the Sangha walks on the newly created path, passing by the new Happy Farm, the 150 new planted trees, looking over the vast, wide open neighboring fields, I rejoice in the going forth of our Sangha and feel how together, we are carrying Thầy’s work into the future.</p>
<p>Dear Plum Village, as a very young disciple, I want to offer you a gift: the story of my practice with one of the mental formations that I have inherited from a long stream of ancestors, their experiences, and inner formations. The name of this mental formation is attachment, and the name of this ongoing story, sometimes going up and sometimes down, is “Hello attachment, you are my friend”.</p>
<p>So, how does this story start? Earlier this year, mister attachment came once more to knock at the door of my heart and started singing his familiar song of fear and desire (the one I first listened to directly the day I went out of my mother’s womb). He sings to me very eloquently, with a powerful voice that can both rise very high and come down to the very low notes, accompanied bywith a whole orchestra. His songssong can be captivating. I have to make a great effort in order not to get too absorbed in themit. Mister attachment is a poet, he has a whole range of metaphors, rhythms, tones, and forms; he is grounded in a whole lineage of artists and his strength comes from the very core of human nature. He is also a philosopher capable of deep reflections, and a scientist, with proven evidence. His songs contain all of that.</p>
<p>Now, do you want to know how he started his lamentation? In the past year, I havehad had a close relationship with my mentor, and I felt that I could share anything with her, that she would understand, love and support me no matter what dark energies were  insidee of me. I enjoyed being with her, embraced by her energy and receiving her guidance. She also taught us the Fine Manners and Precepts, which made my happiness even greater. This happiness gave me great energy to practice. I was aware that in me, part of that inner happiness was based on our teacher-student relationship as well as friendship, but I was also aware that there was some attachment in me. I also understood, that based on my childhood and past experiences, that attachment iswas very natural, and that my elder sister seemed to trust my capacity to be responsible and to practice with the mental formations that came up in me. So I let the relationship unfold naturally. I enjoyed the times we had together sharing, drinking tea, learning or working together. I observed my mind and let the joy and love penetrate me and sing in my thoughts. I didn’t worry because I had faith in my sister, in the Sangha, and in the practice.</p>
<p>Then, naturally, the time came to change mentors and precept teachers. When that time came, sadness arose in me as well as other feelings like loss, the feeling of being abandoned, jealousy and anger.</p>
<p>I am very shy aboutto going togo to my elder sister, so not having her as a mentor or teacher, I could rarely see her or share with her,. I just wrote her letters about my practice from time to time. So the inner child in me started to feel pain: after being so close to her, I saw very little of her, as if we lived veryso far away from each other.</p>
<p>For three days, I held this sadness in my awareness while continuing the daily activities with the Ssangha. Somehow, behind the painful feelings, I also felt faith and had the impression that if I could stay with what was there, I would discover something even more precious than the kind of joy which iswas still tainted by attachment. I felt that if I went through the storm, I would be able to bring more freedom into the relationship. I was also aware that I would need to go through many more storms after this one if I wanted to walk towards freedom. So the only thing to do was to practice.</p>
<p>I observed my body and mind, kept my heart open to moments of joy, of sharing, of working, of sitting and of walking together with the Sangha, I continued to nourish myself with the Dharma. On the third evening, when I came back to my study desk after the evening sitting, I found myself starting to write. I didn’t know it would be a poem, and I didn’t know this poem would be about the Sangha.</p>
<p>But it started to unfold, like as a fruit ripening in my store consciousness. During mythat of time of practice, an insight came up in me ands I experienced how my body and mind arewere veryso different depending on whether or not they arewere in the collective embrace of the Sangha’s energy. Thanks to the pain manifesting in me based on attachment, I wholeheartedly came back to the practice and opened myself to the collective energy of the Sangha, generating a presence in me that allowed theat insight to ripen.</p>
<p>While writing the poem, I suddenly felt so happy. Images from the Sutras came up in me inside of me, praising the Sangha. I didn’t have to make any effort to write it, the sentences just came up from my store consciousness and surprised me. I felt a great happiness because I was experiencing the fruits of entrusting myself to the store consciousness and myand, my deepening roots in the Sangha.</p>
<p>After this poem, the ripening continued in the next days, and I started to feel the energy of attachment loosening and a more stable feeling of being anchored was slowly born. By gently continuing to hold my pain and keeping to the daily practices while in the embrace of the Sangha, I started to feel part of a spiritual stream of wisdom and love that carried me.</p>
<p>I found great joy in studying and practicing the Shikshamana precepts and in directing my mind to the basic Dharma doors throughout the day. Every evening, when I sat at my study desk, a more mature presence arose in me, embracing the vulnerable part. This helpedmade me to be less affected by the emotions and mental formations that came up in me during the day, because I knew I was on firmer ground. It appeared to me that the practice of ’investigation of dharmas’, had naturally been born in me.</p>
<p>After this experience, something began to change. I didn’t want to get caught in attachment anymore because I felt that attachment was an obstacle to getting in touch with the spiritual stream I had found. I wanted to come back to myself toand observe, listen, and embrace.</p>
<p>Of course, attachment is still in me and manifests in daily life. When I see my elder sister, hurt might come up. From time to time, I still miss her and seek her presence. In daily lifelife, , when I am in a situation that might cause the energy of attachment to arise in my body and mind with my elder sister or with other siblings, I can become very tense. Something in me is making me feel like freezing or running away. But there are also the times when I can sit still and reflect on what is happening, and at those times I know that if I stay with the pain, it can become a bridge to inner freedom.</p>
<p>Now, I know that the way is not to want to transform or to fight. Not only with mental formations like attachment, but also with the body, I don’t want to try to walk beautifully, to sit with a straight back, to stand with grace etc… even though monastic beauty touches something very deep in me when I see it manifesting in my sisters. I just want to listen, to understand, to accept and embrace myself, and I have trust that transformation of my body or mental formations will then naturally manifest as a byproduct of love, even if it takes years.</p>
<p>In my heart, I started to feel close to my elder sister again. That closeness was based on the practice of coming back and embracing what came up. I felt how this relationship was helping me to grow, how there was a respect and faith that I couldn’t lose, deep inside of me. This deeper feeling of respect and faith embraced the childlike feeling of missing and seeking.</p>
<p>Since our initial encounter, there have been many more events, and there will beare also many more to come. I still need to suffer a lot to learn to love freely, and many storms will cross my path. When a storm comes to me, I can only do my best to practice and entrust myself to the Sangha. I wholeheartedly put my energy into watering the good seeds in me so that they can balance all the other seeds being dug up and crying inside.</p>
<p>Dear Plum Village, here is the little poem I shared about earlier, which has helped a heart to heal and to grow. It was born in French and then translated into English, because ithe lives in an international Sangha.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Sangha is as vast as the ocean<br/>
High as a mountain<br/>
Free as the unobstructed sky<br/>
The Sangha is a festival of stars<br/>
A full moon brightening the night <br/>
A deep, ancient forest <br/>
The Sangha is protected by a spiritual stream<br/>
Within her, all that occurs is a mirror<br/>
Which gently unveils our minds<br/>
The Sangha is a path to awakening <br/>
Each pebble invites us to takemake a step<br/>
That bringstakes us to the heart of our being<br/>
The Sangha is made of laughter and cries<br/>
Because the Sangha is made of human beings<br/>
Tears purify the heart <br/>
The Sangha is the teacher<br/>
Teaching me resilience,<br/>
Inner strength, acceptance,<br/>
Openness and love<br/>
The Sangha is the sea that collects my tears<br/>
The Sangha is the valley which echoes my laughter<br/>
The Sangha makes me discover that I love what is difficult, because what is difficult makes me grow and frees me<br/>
The Sangha teaches me that Manas, that emotions and hurts<br/>
Are not my true mind<br/>
The Sangha teaches me to stop, to breathe and to smile<br/>
The Sangha teaches me to love my inner child<br/>
Wounded and shy, she suddenly jumps up and runs to join a festival of joy<br/>
Loved among her sisters<br/>
Manas and my inner child walk hand in hand<br/>
Sometimes, I let myself be a child even if then I am also Manas, I am not afraid<br/>
Because the Sangha is both gentle and sharp, seeing straight to into the heart <br/>
The Sangha teaches me silence and the Sangha teaches me laughter and joy<br/>
The Sangha teaches me to be happy and to suffer<br/>
The Sangha teaches me that my body and mind are not separate from the energy of the Sangha<br/>
The Sangha lives in my heart, in my body, my breath<br/>
The Sangha thinks in me and dreams there<br/>
The Sangha eats, drinks, falls asleep and awakes<br/>
She carries me on the ocean of life<br/>
She is the source of my balance, my joy, my energy<br/>
Without her, I cannot say what would manifest in me -how could I know?<br/>
This poem is also the Sangha<br/>
As well as each of my thoughts, my actions and my words<br/>
Today, I cried the tears of the Sangha so that gently, my heart in the heart of the Sangha becomes freer.</p>
</blockquote>

            <h2>A year in lockdown with very elderly parents</h2>
<p>I stood in the hallway, one hand placed lightly on the banister, and breathed slowly.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard the thumping steps of two young girls galloping and laughing up and down the stairs. I saw Dad standing in the hall calling upstairs, and heard sounds of cooking from the kitchen, Mum preparing lunch. Standing in the heart of the now empty house, our  family home for sixty years, I said goodbye and left the spirits of the place to play on.</p>
<p>It had been a long journey. <em>Rewind 18 months to Spring 2019</em> I receive <em>y</em>et another urgent call to come home. My father 96, blind, with failing health may be dying. Over the years I had been preparing myself for their passing and I knew the importance of “Don’t wait.” With deep gratitude for the support of the Lower Hamlet sisters, I left for England. Thankfully Dad rallied once again, but it was not to last. With the UK and France going into full Covid lockdown, I stayed on and was thus able to enjoy two more months by his side. Dad died peacefully in his own bed  on a beautiful May morning with the family all around him, Mum holding his hand. Minutes after my father’s last breath Mum said, with relief, “Well, if that’s what dying’s like, it’s not so bad.”</p>
<p>A carer had shared with me how the family can take care of the body in a respectful and nourishing way. First, my elder sister and I requested to help the nurse mindfully and lovingly wash his body and dress him in his best pyjamas. We asked to keep Dad’s body at home for another day. I surrounded his body with fresh May flowers from the garden that he and Mum had grown and tended for over 60 years. Rose petals were strewn over the bed, lily of the valley placed at his head.</p>
<p>To sit with his body was a wonderful experience. In England the old traditions have been lost and most people want death to leave the house immediately. The close family visited and we were able to sit around Dad and recall our happy memories to honour his life. Mum also had quiet time to say her goodbyes, so essential because they had been married for almost 70 years. When she finally decided that she was definitely going to attend the funeral, on leaving the house in a wheelchair, she was moved to see the whole street gathered to greet and applaud her.</p>
<p>Later when the ceremonies were completed, I had to decide when to return to Plum Village. I felt deeply conflicted because on the one hand how could I leave my Mum to mourn alone, even if she had a wonderful live-in carer to take care of her personal needs? On the other hand, as any of her carers could tell you, Mum is not an easy woman and the idea of staying with her for an extended period was frankly scary.</p>
<p><em>Rewind many years!</em> At 16 I had gladly left home for “Swinging” London, first to attend ballet school, then to art school. I was a rebellious teenager; it was 1972 and I needed SPACE! Later, after my studies in fashion design, I increased the distance, moving to Paris to work as a designer. But no geographical distance was ever enough to heal the unease. I could not bear to be in the same room as my mother. However, a wholesome inner voice advised me “this is not good.”</p>
<p>Ten years of Freudian analysis ensued, years rich with learning and insight; the veils of misperception began to fall. But it was when I engaged with Plum Village practice in 1998 that the deeper healing began, first as a lay practitioner and then as a monastic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Practice</em>:</strong> Centring Mum and Dad, letting go of the child’s need for the parents’ attention and instead, developing curiosity about <em>their</em> lives, encouraging and listening to <em>their</em> stories and thus validating their lives especially as they grew older. This change of dynamic completely transformed our relationship. I learnt about what had conditioned them (education, family, economic situation, the collective consciousness of their epoch) and their often challenging life circumstances as well as their joys. I experienced what Thay has often taught us, that healing becomes possible through understanding, and then compassion and forgiveness emerge naturally without effort.  I saw my parents and myself as vulnerable beings, all doing our best and a strong connection of love grew in my heart.</p>
<p>However, the idea of being locked down with Mum indefinitely was way beyond my comfort zone! But in meditation I gave space to a small, quiet voice that wanted to offer love and support to the only mother I have, who had cared for me as a child and also to relieve my sister who had been caring for my parents for many years, albeit from a distance. On telling my sister these thoughts she exclaimed “What a sacrifice!” But the only sacrifice was the intention to make caring for Mum sacred, a part of my practice. Easy to say, difficult to do! The home I had run away from, fifty years before, now sent phantoms and ghosts to haunt me. My intention was to stay present and stay put. But how?</p>
<p><strong><em>Practice</em>:</strong> A checklist - Am I taking care of my freshness, solidity and joy?  To my surprise I slipped into a regular daily schedule starting the day with meditation to digest and investigate the latest emotional storm which came from around and inside me. To cultivate joy, each day, rain or shine I walked in the nearby forest where I had played as a child, taking refuge in the ancient oak trees, our ancestors, giving them a long hug. Every morning I worked in the garden, accompanied by the robins who had also accompanied Dad. Before dark, I cycled along the beautiful country lanes of Hampshire, empty now during lockdown. I facilitated dharma sharing families for all the Plum Village online retreats and supported the UK Sangha. With all this joy I had enough solidity to offer my presence to Mum.</p>
<p>I was also inspired by the Five Invitations of Frank Ostaseski, founder of the San Francisco Zen Hospice for the Dying, a practitioner who has spent his whole career accompanying the dying:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t wait (at 98, Mum won’t be here long, so it’s now or never)</li>
<li>Welcome everything, push away nothing (this gave me courage)</li>
<li>Bring your whole self to the experience (even my vulnerability, especially my vulnerability)</li>
<li>Find a place of rest in the middle of things (sitting and breathing with Mum)</li>
<li>Cultivate “don’t know mind” (it’s OK to not know how long I’ll be here…)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though Mum was frail, tired, bedridden and very old, sometimes I felt like I was trapped with a dangerous, unpredictable wild animal. I felt like the artist Joseph Beuys who in 1974 as an art “happening” lived in his studio with a wild coyote. I allowed the old fears gradually to come up and saw that they originated from childhood, never knowing how Mum would react, or what mood she might be in when I came home from school. Later we found out that she had periodically suffered from bouts of depression. This, combined with her inability to either recognise or take care of her emotions made an unsafe and threatening emotional environment in which to grow up.</p>
<p>Now, towards the end of her life, Mum would often say things which were rough and hard to hear but my practice was to simply stay present, even if my heart was racing, my stomach churning and I just wanted to run, like I had always done in the past.</p>
<p><strong><em>Practice</em>:</strong>  After coming back to my breath and feeling the earth solid under my feet, I would imagine what she <em>might</em> be feeling and reply “Are you angry? Or tired? Or frustrated?” and to my amazement she would pause and then agree, “Yes, I <em>am</em> angry…” and we would be able to slowly talk it through, carefully putting her strong emotions into words. In a short while, calm was restored, hands held, a hug. It was as if I was lending her my nervous system. I was stunned, we had traversed a difficulty that when I was a child, would have caused her to stop talking to the whole family for several days. For a child these were violent and frightening periods of silence. As a child I would think “It must be my fault, I must be bad.”</p>
<p>Practicing self-compassion for having safely navigated the latest emotional challenge, I took care of my inner child, hers and mine, both of whom had certainly suffered from emotional neglect, though not with intention. I felt compassion for Mum’s frustration, how much she must have suffered through her incapacity to communicate. I felt deep gratitude for Thay, who has enabled me to become my own loving parent. Breathing in, “May I allow Mum to be exactly who she is,” breathing out “may you Mum, feel safe, may you live and die with ease.” And then I would remember to congratulate myself, tapping myself on the shoulder, saying “Well done Tam Muoi, survived again!”</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my stay was finding an old box containing 200 letters that Dad had written to Mum when he had TB. He was diagnosed just five years after they married, and my mother found herself alone taking care of my three-year-old sister, far from any family members. He wrote to her <em>every</em> day even though Mum visited him twice a week! I offered to read the letters to her, although I felt nervous entering into their intimacy. But she replied, “Oh yes, then he will be here with us.” So after each meal, I would read a few letters. It was a real gift, to discover the  sensitive, affectionate man who could write so tenderly. It was lovely to read his enthusiastic dreaming of “another infant” (me!) and of his love for my sister, for whom he made wooden and basketwork toys whilst in the sanatorium.</p>
<p>My “No Escape” retreat would not have been possible without the support of many carers and nurses who were coming in and out throughout the day. We had two principle live-in carers who alternated, three weeks on, three weeks off, Charity from Essex and Zimbabwe, and Marian from London and Uganda. It was a real privilege for me to share my life with these women, supporting each other, or dancing round the kitchen as we cooked together. Not only are they excellent professional carers but we became friends, supporting each other through Mum’s ups, but particularly her downs. Many times, I or they would come back to the kitchen having been roundly scolded by Mum, and we would be there for each other with a hug or a hilarious reflection to bring back a smile. As they shared more about their lives, I was humbled by their capacity for joy, sacrifice and resilience especially as they navigate the challenges of being Black in Britain.</p>
<p>Seven months on, it seemed that Mum was not going to die a few months after Dad (as everyone had thought), and that she really had her eye on getting to 100 (like her cousin Edith), which was still ten months away. I started to think about returning to Plum Village. I had a dream where I was making a delicious meal. I opened the lid of the saucepan to check on the dish and happily exclaimed “It’s cooked!” Waking up I felt a deep sense of fulfilment that lasted for several days.  I felt <em>I</em> was cooked, it was time to go home.</p>
<p><em>Fast forward</em> to two weeks <em>after</em> Mum’s very happy 100<sup>th</sup> birthday party and my sister urged me to phone Mum. On WhatsApp I saw Mum’s beautiful face, tired now, eyes half closed, no longer needing to speak, but smiling as I expressed my love and encouraged her to let go and take a deep, long, much deserved rest. She never woke up, she died in her sleep that night.</p>
<p>The day before her funeral I was able to sit a long while with her body and place a bouquet of flowers in her hands. This is the poem that came to me, which I read out during her service.</p>
<h2>Contemplation on Mum's Body</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your two hands<br/>
Now folded in peace upon your chest<br/>
Were once working tirelessly.<br/>
Caring for family, caressing a child's feverish brow,<br/>
Laundering, chopping the veg,<br/>
Making the tea.<br/>
Or typing furiously,<br/>
Or with hands plunged in warm earth<br/>
Tending your beloved garden.<br/>
Now, fingers and joints are gnarled like the ancient oaks of Sheet.<br/>
Crooked feet, once strode boldly across fields<br/>
And lightly skimmed the dancefloor in the arms of Dad, quickstepping.<br/>
Barefoot, we wandered together through Indian temples<br/>
And hand in hand, paddled along the English shore.<br/>
Breasts, become flat and empty,<br/>
Once plumply suckled two tiny infants<br/>
Whilst you sang to them<br/>
sweet lullabies of love.<br/>
Your eyes, clear and twinkling <br/>
of Wedgewood blue, laughing.<br/>
Gazing on the Queen's card<br/>
received for your one hundred years lived fully,<br/>
You said<br/>
&quot;I am so lucky!&quot;<br/>
Now, your body like old leaves of tea,<br/>
Used up and discarded.<br/>
But we, amongst many,<br/>
Have drunk your tea, your essence.<br/>
You are in each one of us.<br/>
We are your continuation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>As we emptied the house, my whole life was unravelling before me, held in old photos and worn objects, loved and well used. Each cupboard, box or tin opened, more treasures were revealed, and then in their turn,  let go of.</p>
<p>Waking on the morning of leaving for Plum Village, I felt a deep sense of closure. My parents once more together, their ashes buried in the country village churchyard. All is well.</p>

            <h2>May the Smiles from our Hearts</h2>
<p><em>poem to all Bodhisattvas</em></p>
<!-- 9 December 2021 -->
<blockquote>
<p>May the smiles from our hearts<br/>
Pierce through the clouds<br/>
Of our confusion.<br/></p>
<p>May the smiles from our hearts<br/>
Reach you<br/>
Continuing your path<br/>
With courage and freedom.<br/></p>
<p>May the smiles from our hearts<br/>
Melt all your obstacles<br/>
So you can serve all beings<br/>
With peace and wisdom<br/></p>
<p>Let the smiles from our hearts<br/>
Encourage you on and on,<br/>
Like the sun<br/>
Shining everywhere<br/>
With warmth and freedom<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Their Flowers Have Fallen</h2>
<!-- 18 December 2021 -->
<p>Their flowers have fallen<br/></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the leaves of the orchid<br/>
Plant are firm and strong,<br/>
Spreading their arms of greenness<br/>
To the east and west.<br/></p>
<p>Their stems are thin and wobbly<br/>
Attached to wooden sticks<br/>
With pins,<br/>
Yet tiny green buds<br/>
Are pushing through<br/>
On the branches,<br/>
Like little lights of hope:<br/>
Life continues<br/>
And will blossom again.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This poem was written to my orchid plant as I witnessed its changing, impermanent nature over the past two months. Impermanence can also be the continuation of life, and we are filled with happiness and joy on seeing this. The flowers have fallen, yet the tiny buds sing the song of life continuing without end.</p>
<h2>There is the Letting Go</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There is the letting go <br/>
of the song in our hearts<br/>
we have kept so long.<br/></p>
<p>There is the letting go<br/>
That the trees know<br/>
So well, when<br/>
Their leaves fly and fall.<br/></p>
<p>There is the letting go<br/>
And wishing you well<br/>
As streams of life<br/>
Flow forward<br/>
Leaving spaces<br/>
Of memories behind.<br/></p>
<p>There is the letting go<br/>
Which is all of life<br/>
Disappearing<br/>
And reappearing<br/>
With the colors and sounds of spring.<br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This poem was written after the Be-In on 4 December 2021 when we were together with many Sisters who would be leaving New Hamlet in a few days to visit their families in Vietnam,  and then move on to other practice centers. We sang songs to one another and shared from our hearts the beautiful experiences we had at New Hamlet.</p>
<p>It was also the anniversary day of my little brother’s passing away in 1994. I remember his qualities of courage and freedom. The letting go is part of being able to continue to live after experiencing the death of a beloved one.</p>
<h2>A Poem for the New Year</h2>
<!-- 25 December 2021 -->
<blockquote>
<p>Be a source of love<br/>
For them, who are sad<br/>
And lonely, without homes.<br/>
Little things will do, <br/>
And tenderness.<br/></p>
<p>Be a source of love<br/>
For them,<br/>
And for us<br/>
Treading the path<br/>
Of uncertainty<br/>
Under skies<br/>
Of darkness<br/>
And  light.<br/></p>
<p>Offer your compassionate hands<br/>
To everyone, everyone,<br/>
Everywhere.<br/></p>

            <h1 id="safe-harbor" class="chapter">Safe Harbor</h1>
            <div class="author">Sister Chân Tuệ Nghiêm</div>
            <p>My dear younger one,</p>
<p>The day I came to Plum Village thirty years ago, you had just turned one. You cannot imagine what Plum Village was like, or what I was like as a 22-year-old young woman, can you? You would ask - <em>why did you come to Plum Village when there were so few people here and the living conditions so simple? What made you choose Plum Village as a safe harbor in which to live the life of a monastic?</em> Thirty years is a long time, but it also passes by swiftly.</p>
<p>I came to Plum Village during the Summer Retreat of 1992. Plum Village was celebrating its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary and it still went by the name of &quot;Persimmon Village&quot;. My first impression was - <em>I had returned to my homeland, Vietnam</em>. Though I had grown up in the U.S. since I was ten, I felt that I had never truly integrated into the environment and society there. I was not recognized as American because of my black hair and yellow skin.</p>
<p>Coming to Plum Village that year, I became acquainted with many young Vietnamese people who had also grown up in the west. Perhaps everyone felt the same way as I did and therefore when we came together, we could completely accept one another. Everyone opened their hearts to help, support, and love each other. The atmosphere in Plum Village,  Thay’s Dharma talks, and the presence of the brothers and sisters had created a truly wholesome and pure environment filled with serenity and love. In just a week, our group of young people had become close friends. I have been nourished by that love and friendship throughout these 30 years. <em>Here</em> is my true home because it is here that I have found love, humanity, acceptance, joy, safety, and teachings to help me embrace difficulties and live in kindness.</p>
<p>Thay liked to see young people, whether a young man or a young woman, wearing the traditional Vietnamese long robe. We had many opportunities to wear the long robe during the week - while listening to Thay's Dharma talk, or during tea meditation, and various ceremonies. You know what my dear? It was the first time in my life to wear the long robe regularly like that. After lunch and dinner, the young friends gathered around under the two oak trees of Lower Hamlet by the bamboo grove. Every day I was nourished and grew a little through the songs, zen music, sparkling laughter, and friendship. After one month I went back to the U.S. with joy and warmth in my heart. I knew I had a beautiful and wholesome path and what's more, there were such lovely and kind friends from Europe and America walking along it with me.</p>
<p>I decided to come back to Plum Village to live for one year.. I had just graduated from university and it was a time for me to explore the world before pursuing further studies. I returned just before the Winter Retreat. There was a stark difference between the summer and winter. This time there were only about 15 brothers and sisters there and a few lay friends. I was the only young person in Lower Hamlet. <em>The air was cold, the rain wet and the mud muddy.</em> My friends were not there, there was no TV, no movies, no internet, and no being busy in order to avoid facing myself. I had a very hard time getting through this period. There was sufficient space and conditions for some deeply embedded pain and suffering from the past to manifest. I had no choice but to find ways to alleviate my pain and suffering. Fortunately, Thay’s teachings, the love of the sisters and of my blood brother Brother Phap Dang enabled me to have the courage to come back to myself, embrace, and look into my mind.</p>
<p><em>One element that helped me greatly was nature, Mother Earth</em>. Apart from mealtimes, resting, sleeping, and sitting meditation, I spent all day in nature to be with the trees, the sky and the earth. Nature became a dear friend that helped me to have the joy and strength needed to face my inner pain.</p>
<p>Plum Village was still very poor then. The houses were simple and shabby. I slept in a building that was used for drying tobacco in the past. The building had red brick walls and a cement floor. Our beds were just a plank of wood on four bricks. If you wanted to use the toilet in the middle of a cold night, you had to go outside. There was no hot water in the bathroom. A hot shower was deemed a miracle and a great happiness! Can you imagine that the one thing I always cherished and was grateful for was the central heating in this building. There were other houses that only had a small wood-fired stove in the room for heating. When the firewood ran out in the night, those rooms were as cold as the outdoors.</p>
<p>Although there were only a dozen or so brothers and sisters, the atmosphere was warm and cozy, like a family. We sang before walking meditation and after the meals, we often gathered to drink a fragrant cup of tea, to sing, recite poetry, laugh and share stories. Whatever the sangha activity was, everyone was present. Despite being poor, Plum Village was rich with love, brotherhood and sisterhood and friendship. My heart continued to open. I treasured each day, treasured the opportunity to go back to a simple, wholesome life where we had the time to renew ourselves. This way of life made me feel fulfilled, as if I had realized a long awaited dream .</p>
<p>After spending one year in Plum Village, I went back to the U.S.. It felt as if I had lived on top of a high mountain, away from the world for a year. Going home was like descending the mountain to enter a life full of woe and trouble. But this time, my eyes were bright to see the things I had not seen before or took for granted as the norm.</p>
<p>The first thing I saw was that everyone was working to amass money. That seemed to be everyone's mode of seeking happiness. Consumption created so much waste for Mother Earth and few noticed it. The second thing I saw was that everyone had difficulties and suffering but they did not know how to handle them. They only looked for ways to escape and forget, causing so much pain for themselves and their loved ones. I also saw the difficulties my blood sisters and brothers encountered in their relationships with their spouses and children. Meanwhile, my elder brother who had become a monk lived joyfully and was helping many people to touch happiness. <em>The simple and profound life of a monastic in Plum Village was my path, my direction.</em> That was why I decided to return to Plum Village and ask to become a nun.</p>
<p>Thirty years is a long journey. Looking back, I have gone through many stages of change both in me and within the Plum Village community. I remember that before embarking on the spiritual life, I also had fears and worries. <em>Will I be happy and walk this path fully for life?</em> I looked at my brother and at Thay - two people who were walking solidly, happy, and helping to alleviate the suffering of many others. That gave me the firm conviction to enter a new life as a young monastic.</p>
<p>There were certainly ups and downs in my monastic life. But those times also helped me to realize that my purpose of becoming a nun was exactly to handle my inner difficulties, to understand their roots and transform them. There were moments when I saw that I was still weak in the face of emotional relationships. I struggled with my mind; but I made the clear determination that <em>I had ordained to be free from emotional entanglements, so that I could cultivate a Buddha's love in my heart.</em> Gradually I saw that the noble purpose of monastic life is to transform suffering, to come into the light of happiness and freedom, and to become a Dharma instrument capable of helping others see a beautiful and wholesome path. Looking back, I see that the difficulties were the food that strengthened and nurtured my beginner's mind. They helped me touch a spaciousness within and a deeper understanding of myself.</p>
<p>The difficulties were there, but at the same time, joy, happiness, and peace were also always present. Every day I grew as a nun amidst the nourishing and wholesome songs, poems, gathas, nature, laughter, and brotherhood and sisterhood. What more does one need? <em>I already had what I dreamt of for my life.</em> I no longer needed to wander here and there to search for happiness. Happiness and peace are tangible qualities I can touch and savor each day. Slowly, my age-old difficulties were transformed without my knowing.</p>
<p>The longer I live in the sangha, the more I see how I metamorphose. The more I practice, the more I see wonders manifesting around and within me. The more I practice, the more I understand things that were mere theories to me before.</p>
<p>The death of my mother was the event that shook me the most in my life. Mom had already been ill for six years. Her body grew weaker and weaker and lost the ability to function normally. When mom was passing away, I felt it was time for her to let go of that aged and diseased body. I knew she was being continued by her children and grandchildren. However, when mom left, I still felt a void in my heart - <em>I will never see her form, hear her voice, or be able to hug her and touch her physically again</em>.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt a great loss and an intense grief. I have already been trained since first coming to Plum Village that only by embracing the feeling of loss and grief could I understand, calm and transform it. Those trainings had become a bell of mindfulness, helping me to come back to ease and transform my loss and grief. When I returned to myself with the energy of mindfulness in each breath, I recognized the truth that mom was present in me. I could be in touch with her. <em>Mom is here. Mom is always here.</em> We are the continuation of our mother through our virtues and habits. We just need to return to the breath, to the body, and to the present moment to see our mother in us. This is a truth - the truth of interbeing. Mother and child are one. Child is a continuation of mother.</p>
<p>When I touched this truth, the grief and sense of loss gradually transformed. Whenever I felt uneasy, I came back to the body and the breath, silently calling, &quot;mom, oh dear mom&quot;, and mom was there right away to love and help me face the mind of uneasiness. I realized that I am practicing for myself and at the same time practicing for mom. Seeing the interbeing between mother and child is the gateway for me to arrive at the insight of my interbeing with everyone, with the cosmos.</p>
<p>My dear younger one, if we can taste the insight of non-self and interbeing through our own body and mind, then we can taste happiness and great freedom right here and right now. <em>That</em> is the true path of a monastic.</p>

            <p>Dear sangha<span class="note">Editor's note: In this article we distinguish between the &quot;Sangha&quot; of the Three Jewels (which consist of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) and &quot;sangha&quot; when it refers to a community of practitioners.</span>, today is the 14<sup>th</sup> of October, 2010. We are in the Space Beyond Space Meditation Hall in Pak Chong, Thailand, during our monastic retreat with the theme of “The Plant Nursery”.</p>
<img id="articlephotossu-ongTheTrueSangha2" class="" src="../../media/build/article_photos/su-ong/PcFADLcaEH-2000.jpeg" decoding="async">
<h2>Insight without boundaries</h2>
<p>In Sino-Vietnamese we have the term Phương Ngoại Phương (<span lang="zh">方外方</span> Fāng wài fāng). “Phương” means space. A practitioner really needs space. Space is the essence of freedom and liberation. The purpose of a practitioner is to bring more space into our hearts, to truly offer space to ourselves and to those around us. We can only realize this space through practice, through insight and compassion.</p>
<p>Insight and compassion always go together. Anyone who has insight and compassion also has happiness and no longer suffers. Compassion and insight are not two separate entities. They have a very close relationship. Insight comes from compassion and compassion comes from insight: without one there cannot be the other. In Buddhism, when we speak of love we always speak of the <em>Four Immeasurable Minds</em> (Four brahmavihāras), namely loving kindness (maitrī), compassion (karuṇā), joy (muditā), and inclusiveness (upekṣā). These four minds are limitless. That is why they are called immeasurable, which means a mind without boundaries or borders. Love in Buddhism is the kind of love that does not have boundaries. All of the different Buddhist traditions teach the <em>Four Immeasurable Minds</em> and all traditions recognize that love has no limit and is boundless. If it is limited then it is not the true love of a Buddha.</p>
<p>This is very important because true love is made of insight. Without understanding there cannot be love and we can experience this for ourselves. If a father cannot understand the difficulties of his child then the more he loves his child, the more he makes his child suffer. The same is true between teacher and disciple. If a teacher does not understand the difficulties and suffering of their disciples, then the teacher does not know yet how to love them or help them. Therefore, a teacher’s responsibility is to understand their disciples. Only when a teacher understands deeply their disciples’ difficulties, suffering, and struggles do they truly have love, and from then on, whatever the teacher says, teaches, and does can be of help. Before that, no matter how much the teacher wishes to love their disciples, it would not be true love. The same goes for disciples towards their teachers.</p>
<p>Now we come to an important conclusion- if compassion is boundless then insight is also boundless. If love is boundless then understanding is also boundless. That is why we need to look again at the term sarvajñatā (<span lang="zh">一切智</span> Yíqìe zhì). In Sanskrit, “all-knower,” “all-knowledge,” or “omniscience” (Nhất Thiết Trí) or “complete enlightenment” (Toàn Giác) saṃbodhi / vidyācaraṇasampanna. The insight that is considered “omniscience” needs to be the insight without boundaries. If anyone says that they already have enough insight and there is nothing higher to attain, that is not the insight of a Buddha. As students of the Buddha, we always praise him as the one who has reached the highest, unsurpassable understanding. This is because we love and respect the Buddha. The Buddha may not necessarily agree with our praise. That being said, many will continue to praise the Buddha thus because for thousands of years they have been accustomed to thinking in that way. Praising the Buddha as the One who has attained <em>Unsurpassed Complete Perfected Enlightenment</em> (anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi, <span lang="zh">無上正等覺</span>) means his insight has reached the highest point, which also means that it has boundaries, that it is limited. We cannot be sure that is true, because if love can be boundless, then the insight which that love is made of is also boundless. It can always be more vast. This is a koan, a topic for us to look deeply into and contemplate. If we are caught in dogma then we can never understand.</p>
<h2>Does the Buddha still need to practice?</h2>
<p>In the sutras it is clearly recorded that after the Buddha reached enlightenment, he continued to practice walking meditation, to practice the full awareness of breathing, to eat meals in silence, and to participate in dharma discussion with the monks. We ask: those who have not yet become Buddhas need to practice, but why continue to practice when one has become an awakened one? If you gave yourself time to look deeply, you would find the answer - because practicing like that is not only to become a Buddha. Only becoming a Buddha is not enough.</p>
<p>What purpose do those practices serve if not to become a Buddha? The answer is very clear. It is because those practices nourish us. The Buddha also has a body and a daily life, and he also has the need to be nourished and to heal through the practice.</p>
<h2>Building sangha - the career of Buddhas</h2>
<p>What are you going to do when you become a Buddha? You become awakened to help living beings. Becoming a Buddha is only the beginning. Every Buddha has a career to fulfill. Therefore, after realizing the Path, Shakyamuni Buddha sat at the foot of the Bodhi tree to nourish himself by the energy of awakening. Then he started to think about his career. His career was the task of building a Sangha. If there was not the Sangha, then one Buddha alone also could not accomplish much. Because there was a Sangha, the Buddha was able to fulfill his career. The Buddha’s Sangha could bring the teachings to the world. The Buddha had many things to do.  It wasn’t that once he became a Buddha he was done.</p>
<h2>Practicing with the sangha</h2>
<p>One thing we need to clearly see is that the Buddha transmitted the teachings not for us to practice on our own. The sutras, sastras and vinaya all say that the teaching of the Buddha is meant to be practiced as a community and not as an individual. When we receive the precepts, whether as a novice, bhikshu, bhikshuni, or lay practitioner, we have to recite the precepts. Not reciting the precepts is a transgression. But who do we recite the precepts with? We recite them with fellow practitioners. Novices recite the precepts with novices; bhikshus with bhikshus, and bhikshunis with bhikshunis. For the three-month Rains Retreat, we also have to go where we can practice together with fellow practitioners. To practice, you need a sangha. The Three Refuges form the foundation of practice life. When we say, “<em>Sangham saranam gacchami - I take refuge in the Sangha</em>,” it means that I vow to never leave the Sangha. If we do not take refuge in the Sangha, we are not a child of the Buddha. This is very clear.</p>
<p>To think that we can retreat to the mountains to practice to become a Buddha and do whatever we want, because living with humans is complicated and bothersome, is a very wrong perception. Therefore, if anyone has that idea, you should let go of it right away. To practice is to always practice with a sangha. However, if we are living with a sangha that has many weaknesses and shortcomings, one which does not operate according to our wishes, then we should know what to do in order to help improve the quality of our sangha.</p>
<p>When we practice alone, the energy of mindfulness and concentration generated by us may still be weak. It is not yet strong enough for us to transform and bring more space to our heart. When we come to a sangha where many know how to practice and how to generate the energy of mindfulness and concentration, we will see this is a powerful source of energy. We can borrow from it to do the work of transformation that we alone cannot do.</p>
<p>Like a drop of water flowing towards the sea, it knows that it can hardly succeed alone. It could evaporate half-way, become a cloud, wander here and there and never reach the sea. But if that drop of water enters a river and allows the river to embrace and transform it, then for sure it will arrive at the sea. As practitioners we must allow the sangha to lead, embrace, and carry us, for us to succeed.</p>
<h2>True sangha</h2>
<p>The sangha is a community of people practicing together. It has the capacity to generate the energy of mindfulness (<em>smṛti</em>) and concentration (<em>samādhi</em>). When breathing or walking, we breathe and walk in such a way that we can generate more mindfulness and concentration. When we interact with a sangha, a community that is practicing like that, we will recognize this energy right away. That is a true sangha. If we interact with a group of people who are donning brown robes or yellow sanghati, yet we do not sense a strong energy of mindfulness and concentration, then that means they are not a true sangha yet. It could be that the group has the form of a sangha but not the essence of a sangha.</p>
<p>A true sangha (<em>Chân Tăng</em>) is a community that has the practice and can generate true Dharma. When breathing and walking, they can generate the energy of mindfulness and concentration of breathing, of walking. When eating, drinking water, washing dishes, brushing teeth, they have the capacity to generate mindfulness and concentration. When we encounter a strong collective energy of mindfulness and concentration, we know it is a true sangha where one can take refuge.</p>
<p>You are a fortunate person if you can meet such a sangha because such a sangha contains the right Dharma (<em>True Dharma, Chân Pháp</em>). The Dharma we speak about here is not the spoken Dharma or the Dharma recorded in writing or books. The spoken and written Dharma is also the Dharma, but it is not as precious as the <strong>living Dharma</strong>. The living Dharma is when you breathe or walk in mindfulness and concentration. You do not need to speak or write. By your breath, your steps, smiles, the way you brush your teeth or wash clothes, you can generate the living Dharma, the true, present Dharma. If the Dharma is present, then the Buddha is also present and this is called the True Buddha (<em>Chân Bụt</em>). It is not a Buddha carved from stone, sculpted from clay, molded from copper, or painted with oil on canvas. The True Buddha is made of the energies of mindfulness, concentration, and insight. Shakyamuni is called the Buddha because he has the energies of mindfulness, concentration, and insight. If a monastic has those energies, they are also an awakened one. Whether that Buddha is great or small depends on the strength of these energies.</p>
<p>There are people who ask, “Where can we find the Buddha today?” That is very easy to answer. When you can find a sangha with the practice, with the capacity to generate mindfulness, concentration, and insight, then you have found the Dharma - and when you have found the Dharma, the Buddha is there. The Buddha is truly present in the Dharma and Sangha.</p>
<h2>Taking refuge in the sangha to practice and help the world</h2>
<p>This morning we chanted the sutra <em>Knowing the Better Way to Live Alone</em> after sitting meditation. Living alone does not mean separating from the sangha and retreating to the mountains. There are many sutras in the Majjhimanikāya (<em>Collection of Middle Length Discourses</em>) that speak of living alone, including the <em>The Ideal Lover of Solitude</em> (“Bhaddekarattasutta”, MN131). Some have translated it as Nhất Dạ Hiền Giả Kinh (<em>“A Single Excellent Night”</em>). In the sutra it states that we should not allow the past or the future to pull us away. We should dwell and contemplate on what is happening in the present moment. It is through this contemplation that we can untangle, transform and then make space in our heart so we can be happy.</p>
<p>Therefore, one who lives alone here is actually a person who knows how to live in the present moment. That person can live alone with the sangha and not lose themselves in crowds or be carried away by the majority. While practicing walking meditation, sitting meditation, or eating with a sangha of two thousand people, you are still you. You do not lose yourself and you benefit from the collective energy of the sangha. That is how wonderful <em>taking refuge in the Sangha</em> really is!</p>
<p>In bygone days, the Buddha had put much time and effort into building a sangha.  After realizing enlightenment, the first thing he did was to find members to create a sangha. The largest group he received as monastics were the 500 disciples of Uruvelā Kāśyapa and the community of Uruvelā’s two brothers, who were originally Brahmins. Within the space of ten days the Buddha had more than one thousand disciples. Those monks did not know the practice yet. The Buddha brought them all to Elephant Head Peak (Gayasisa) and began to teach them starting with each breath, each step, the way to hold their alms bowl, to walk, stand, lie down, and sit. After a few weeks of training, he then allowed them to return to Rājagaha for their first alms’ round.</p>
<p>At that time the Buddha did not yet have Śāriputra, Mahāmaudgalyāyana or other skillful monks to assist him. He himself had to train one thousand newly ordained bhikshus. It was no easy feat but the Buddha did it very well. In less than a year he built a sangha of one thousand two hundred fifty monastics. The World Honored One is an excellent sangha builder.</p>
<p>The Sangha is a crucial element for the realization of a Buddha’s career. Even an awakened one needs a sangha, let alone we who are not yet fully Buddhas. Therefore, “<em>I take refuge in the Sangha”</em> is not a mere proclamation. We need to stick to the sangha, build the sangha, and not be separated from the sangha. If you do not have a sangha, then day and night you should maintain the aspiration in your heart to find ways to build a sangha. Not having a sangha means not having a place of refuge. Therefore, do not think that <em>“Sangham saranam gacchami - I take refuge in the Sangha”</em> is a proclamation of faith. It is no other than the <strong>career of sangha building</strong>.</p>
<p>When we practice listening to the bell or walking meditation, we stop speaking and stop thinking (even though thinking is not audible, it is a kind of mental chatter). We do this by placing all of our attention on our breath and the sound of the bell or our steps. In this way we generate the energy of mindfulness and concentration. To have mindfulness and concentration is to have the protection of the Three Jewels. That is what taking refuge really is. We cannot say for sure that when we read out “<em>I take refuge in the Buddha, I take refuge in the Dharma, I take refuge in the Sangha”,</em> we will receive protection from the Three Jewels.</p>
<p>The Three Jewels are the energies of mindfulness and concentration. Every sound of the bell, every step with such energy can heal, nourish, and liberate. If you practice it well, every sound of the bell, every step can help you be in touch with the pure land, in touch with no birth and no death. It isn’t difficult! We can all do it. It is not a distant wish. We can realize this path by the way we walk and with the bell of mindfulness. Together with the sangha, we can make the pure land become a reality in the present with every step we take, by placing all our heart into the sound of the mindfulness bell.</p>

<p>If we want to be a beloved disciple of the Buddha, then we should learn the art of sangha building. If I want to be a beloved student of the Buddha, then I also have to learn the art of sangha building. Thay would build a beloved sangha with many people who have the determination to practice. The result would be a great reward.</p>
<h2>Brotherhood and Sisterhood - important food of a practitioner</h2>
<p>When I was a young monk, a newly ordained bhikshu no older than twenty something, my deepest desire was to build a beloved <em>sangha</em>. I already used the term beloved <em>sangha</em> then — a place in which brothers and sisters live together in brotherhood and sisterhood, loving each other like blood siblings, going together as a river. I never had the idea of being a leader or an abbot. There was nothing attractive about that to me.</p>
<p>In the years 1954 to 1955, I had the opportunity to realize that dream for the first time. At that time, my country was divided into two. The An Quang Buddhist Institute fell into a crisis, the monks were confused and unstable and they did not know what future lay ahead of them. The venerable Dharma Teacher committee could not console the monks or reorganize the An Quang Buddhist Institute. I was very close to the young monks and nuns and showed them the way to traverse that difficult moment. The Venerable Thich Tinh Khiet at An Quang Temple supported me with all his love and trust.</p>
<p>A few months ago while in Plum Village, I had a dream. It was very simple, but it made me very happy. I dreamt that I woke up at a temple or a practice center where I felt a very joyful atmosphere of practice. While still lying on the bed, I asked an attendant nearby, “What is it that is so joyful?” He answered, “Dear Thay, a number of brothers and sisters just returned. We are cooking a pot of rice to eat together.”  Still in the dream, I sat up, stepped out into the temple courtyard and did walking meditation. I looked into each orchid, the bamboo grove, every tree and blossom. My heart was filled with joy as if there was a festival because I felt I was living in the heart of the sangha. There was nothing to it. Just a few brothers and sisters returning to the temple. Just a pot of rice being cooked so they could eat together. Just the orchids and the bamboo in the yard. But why was I so happy? Because we still had each other, because we had brotherhood and sisterhood. A simple dream, but it made me happy for many days. It is exactly that brotherhood and sisterhood, that simple happiness which propels us to practice for our entire life. A practitioner also needs food. The key food that helps us to practice our entire life is brotherhood and sisterhood.</p>
<p>I want to transmit my happiness and experience to you, my students. If you want to be a happy practitioner, if you want to practice your whole life and fulfill the career of a practitioner, then you should aspire to build a harmonious community with brotherhood and sisterhood. With such a community, not only will you be nourished, you will also help the world more. Without his sangha, the Buddha would not have fulfilled his great career and handed it down to us. It is the same today. As descendants of the Buddha, we should make that aspiration: I vow to follow in the footsteps of the Buddha, to build a sangha that has brotherhood and sisterhood, a happy sangha where I can be nourished and help the world.</p>
