        <h2 class="author">Br. Chân Trời Ruộng Đức</h2>
        <p>Time passes by so quickly. Entering the third year of life as a novice, looking again at my bodhichitta, I ask myself, why am I here? Am I waking up a little bit more everyday? In the past I gave food, medicine, clothes, and provided accommodation for people who were in need. My thinking was that they would feel happy and satisfied once they had received help, but in fact the situation was not like that, what I offered only helped them in part. I saw that after they had received material support, they were still not happy and continued to wait for assistance, so we had to continue to look for a way to help them. At that time I didn't know how to practice and so I created a burden for myself. When l saw that they were unhappy, I also became unhappy. I started to ask myself, why is it like this?</p>
<p>After practicing in Plum Village, I can see that my joy and happiness are increasing a little bit more each day. I am learning to listen to the voice in myself more, and learning to understand myself. I have an aspiration to take care of my inner garden and to discover more about my life.</p>
<p>At this time last year, my father passed away and I felt that my mother and siblings needed my presence and support, so I travelled back home to Malaysia to visit them. I am very grateful to the Sangha for giving me this opportunity. During my home visit, I could feel that the outside environment was tempting me but also that people’s lives were full of pressures and challenges. After a few weeks of staying outside of the monastery, I suddenly had a feeling of missing the sangha. Even though I practiced morning and evening sitting meditation, and walking meditation everyday, it was still easy for me to get carried away by the energy that was surrounding me. Because of this, I had to keep reminding myself again and again to come back to myself. I realized that to practice together with the sangha is easier than to practice alone and that it is so crucial to get nourished by the sangha’s collective energy, to take refuge in the sangha. The sangha and its practice can help me purify my body and mind every day. No matter how difficult and challenging life is, the sangha is always there to support me.</p>
<p>A few months ago, l moved to Son Ha Temple (near Upper Hamlet) to join the sangha there. In the beginning, living together with the sangha was not easy for me, especially when I did not know how to take care of myself. But thanks to the guidance and support of my mentors Br. Nguyen Tinh and Br. Phap Ao, I have been learning ways to take care of my suffering, and I don’t know where I would be without them.</p>
<p>The climate in Son Ha is quite humid and cold compared to the Upper Hamlet. When winter came, the temperature began to decline and the room became very cold, especially because my mentor never uses the heater and l wish to follow his way of living.</p>
<p>However, thanks to his example and his way of training, my body began to accept the environment slowly. My mentor knows that l am afraid of the cold. Thanks to his kindness, I was able to change to a thicker quilt and the problem of keeping warm when sleeping was solved. I can now sleep peacefully at night. Sometimes I would think to myself: right this moment, there are many people, especially children, who are living in abject poverty, who do not have enough clothes for the winter. I am very lucky to have enough clothes to wear and to continue to practice.</p>
<p>Staying in the sangha, I have many chances to practice, like inviting the great temple bell, doing the morning chant, leading walking meditation, and offering guided sitting meditation. I know I am a shy person, but thanks to these opportunities, I am slowly able to overcome my shyness. This brings me a lot of courage in the practice.</p>
<p>Working in the greenhouse has been the most wonderful gift for me during this year's Rain’s Retreat. I want to share with you the process of enjoying the work with my mentors in the greenhouse. At first I thought that to work in the greenhouse is to offer vegetables to the sangha, but actually this is not the main purpose.</p>
<p>When we started working, my mentor Br. Phap Ao started to cut the grass with a trimmer, and Br. Nguyen Tinh and I used tools to remove the weeds together. We began to loosen the soil and create rectangular beds. We watered the soil and left it to be nourished by the water. Dry soil cannot absorb water easily, so it took a long time for water to soak in. Br. Phap Ao just smiled and said to me, &quot;You just keep watering it everyday.” Oh… It sounded like he wanted to tell me something, but what?</p>
<p>After working in the greenhouse for just two days, I had already released a lot of the stress and tension in my body and mind. After a few days of watering, we used chicken manure to fertilize the soil and now the soil could absorb the water easily.</p>
<p>My mentors started sowing seeds and told me to keep watering them every day. After a few days of taking care, I saw the seeds begin to sprout. A few days later, seedlings started to grow. My mentors transferred some seedlings to another place, so they had enough space to grow.</p>
<p>During one afternoon of mindful service, while I was watering the seedlings wholeheartedly, I suddenly realized that the seedlings were smiling at me. Oh… so wonderful! It was the first time I could see this clearly. For me this was a very precious moment, and this is also what my mentors wanted to tell me.</p>
<p>When the seedlings began to grow into vegetables, the weeds also gradually grew. I just kept watering the vegetables and didn’t take care of the weeds. One morning when I was enjoying a cup of tea with my mentor, who knew that I didn't take care of the weeds, he smiled and said to me, &quot;You only know how to water the vegetables.” After that I realized that as I’m watering the vegetables, at the same time, I have to take care of the weeds. One afternoon when l was removing the weeds with my mentor Br. Nguyen Tinh, I found that I could not uproot all of the weeds because the vegetables did not have strong enough roots. I could only trim the weeds above ground. He looked at me, smiled, and said that maybe you need to wait for the vegetables to be strong enough before you can uproot the weeds. I listened and I had to wait patiently for the vegetables to grow stronger.</p>
<p>Autumn was coming to an end. I saw that the arugula (rocket) was about to die, so I took out the arugula plants together with the weeds. I noticed that the stems of the vegetables and the roots of the weeds crossed over one another in many places. I separated them all from each other and replanted the arugula, and after a few days, new leaves started to grow. I was so happy! I looked at the arugula and asked myself, can I do the same thing with my suffering?</p>
<p>One afternoon when I was harvesting vegetables, my mentor Br. Phap Ao told me that starting from today, I would have to come here to catch slugs every early morning and evening. The holes in the vegetables were the traces left by the slugs after they enjoyed the leaves. After I received my mentor’s message, a strong curiosity arose in my heart. Is there any relationship between the slugs and my life? Starting from that day, almost every morning and evening I stepped into the greenhouse in order to find the answer. After I caught more than one thousand slugs, I still did not have the answer. During sitting meditation one night, while I was contemplating my breathing, suddenly the image of the slugs appeared in front of me and I realized that maybe this is the message my mentor wanted to tell me, but I wanted to confirm whether it was true. That night I stayed in the greenhouse for two and a half hours. I started to catch the slugs and not long after, suddenly I saw something I have not seen before. I felt joy arise. Yes, this is it!</p>
<p>As my mentors gave me the opportunity to take care of the greenhouse, I realized that working in the greenhouse is not separate from my practice. Every time I take care of the greenhouse, I am, at the same time, taking care of myself and others. Whatever happens in the greenhouse also happens to me and this is what my mentors wished for me to practice. I need to learn how to take care of myself and to find my own way to cultivate joy and happiness in my daily life, to know how to water the wholesome seeds within me and to take care of the unwholesome seeds when they manifest. I always come back to myself to listen to the voices in me and to understand a little more about them, because they are my little friends within and have been with me for a long time. In the past I did not know they were there and I always neglected them. When they came I had a tendency to not welcome them and to try to escape because the feeling was so unpleasant. Now I know that l have to recognize, identify, and spend some time with them when they arise. This is an opportunity for me to express my love and care for them. By doing this I have built a relationship with them. I am starting to understand a little bit more about myself and my parents — about why they suffered in the past, because the suffering I have now is also the suffering of my parents, who have been carrying it for a long time, and I will continue to practice for them.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is happiness. This energy can help me to recognize and to take good care of suffering. The energy of happiness can heal suffering. When the suffering has been taken care of by the energies of compassion and love, I can still continue to enjoy my life and I won’t get carried away by suffering day and night. The way of taking care of suffering is the way of healing. When healing is taking place, I am already in the process of transformation. I do not need to do many things in order to transform suffering, because everything is organic. I just allow myself to be nourished by wholesome energy everyday and this makes me much lighter and more at ease. I can enjoy nature and practice together with the sangha. This can help me to embrace suffering when it manifests. That is very helpful. It is just like what my mentor said, when the vegetables grow strong enough, uprooting the weeds is easier.</p>
<p>My suffering has a lot to do with the thoughts that I produce every day. I have a tendency to perceive things in a negative way and to not always be open to the different views of the people who work with me. Sometimes I feel others have to follow my way of doing things and so the way I speak becomes unmindful, and those people may suffer once they get close to me. That is my habit energy. I can feel that these negative energies are not operating independently, that they are connecting to each other and functioning at the same time. They are not separate from each other. Once the distorted views in me are in contact with the negative mental formations, they bring about an unpleasant feeling. Sometimes this affects some part of my body and makes me feel uncomfortable. If I am not aware of this, they will keep feeding each other again and again, and then l suffer day and night and maybe more. Once I can recognize my perceptions and am able to stop, I have a chance to ask myself, “Am I sure?” I am then able to come back to myself. With appropriate attention, the negative energies are taken care of by mindfulness and compassion. These wholesome energies start to lead them in a more positive way. When the positive energies are taking place, soon after they bring me a pleasant feeling and my way of looking at things is also led in a positive way. I need to keep practicing in my daily life to discover more about myself. There is no end to the process. I have gratitude for my mentors, because they know what kind of nourishment and practice is most important for me now. I can see how important it is to take refuge in mentors.</p>
<p>I am still young in the practice and I hope that I can continue to have the guidance and support of my mentors and the sangha. Every morning I offer happiness to my mentor while we enjoy a cup of tea and listen to the birds singing. This is also an opportunity for me to ask him questions about the practice and thanks to his compassion and understanding, I can receive and learn many things about the practice from him. To me, these are the most precious moments in my life.</p>
<p>In the past, I thought that happiness is somewhere else and that there may be something better than home, that I needed to pursue something in order to gain happiness. But when I achieved that something and still could not feel happy, I continued to look for for another kind of happiness.</p>
<p>One morning while having a cup of tea in silence with my mentor, I suddenly realized that happiness is in the here and now. Gratitude, joy, and peace are in this moment. It is already happiness. What else could l wish for? How lucky I am to be a monk and to be practicing together with the sangha here. Thay and our elder brothers and sisters established Plum Village, and I can see that all the conditions from the past until now were not necessarily easy. I will cherish my life here and the conditions that have been created by Thay and the sangha.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I received two koans from my mentor. The first one is, “The lizard and the frog can help to eat some of the slugs, but they cannot eat all of the slugs.” Why is that? The second one is, “Why do the slugs only eat the vegetables and not the weeds?” Again, why is that? These two koans are insights from my mentor. He has thrown them to me, but I am still cooking them and I hope that I can tell you more in the future.</p>
