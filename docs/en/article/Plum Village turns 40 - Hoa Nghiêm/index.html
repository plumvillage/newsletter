        <h1 id="ch1" class="chapter">Plum Village Turns 40</h1>
        <h2 class="author">Sr. Chân Hoa Nghiêm</h2>
        <p>Plum Village, in the 1980s and 1990s was like a rural village, still very rustic. There were very few people there and life was quite simple. Our room only had a table and a bed. The bed was nothing but a plank of wood on top of four bricks. On my ordination day, my elder sister, Sister Doan Nghiem, offered me a set of faded brown short robes. I also received a top from Sister Vien Quang and a pair of pants from Sister Chan Vi so I could have another complete set of short robes. Thay also gave me one grey long robe, which I liked very much. At that time, I was only half my current age. I was young and full of spirit. I was quite active and eager to do everything. I volunteered to work in the garden because our food was very basic then and we ate what we planted in the garden. But I was born and grew up in the city so gardening was something very new to me. I followed Sister Chan Vi to learn how to garden. We were so keen on digging the soil that we even skipped evening sitting meditation sessions. Sister Chan Vi and I were scolded by Sister Thanh Luong: “You are here to practice, not to work!” We immediately went to her to begin anew because she was our eldest sister at the time.</p>
<p>When the seeds of the pumpkins and tomatoes germinated, I was besotted with the baby plants, and watched them grow every day. On lazy days, my elder sister, Sister Bao Nghiem woke me up at 6 a.m. so that I could go with her and sister Chan Vi to the garden to catch slugs. Like snails, slugs really like to eat young pumpkin, squash or vegetable plants. It only took a slug one morning to chew up a young pumpkin plant, negating all our hard work of two Spring months to sow the seeds and water the plants. In one morning like that we could fill up a whole jar with slugs. Sister Chan Vi looked at me, smiling, “Hoa Nghiem, now we bring them to a new economic-zone.” I looked back at her, surprised, “Where would that new economic-zone be?” She laughed out loud, “We will bring them to the woods. There they don’t have vegetables to eat, they will eat only grass.” I realized then what she meant. I reckoned it was better that they ate grass instead of being killed. There were gardeners who sprayed pesticides on the young plants and vegetables. Without knowing it, slugs ate the sprayed plants and burst their bellies and died. Thay often told us that we could share half of the vegetables with the slugs and we eat only half rather than killing them as it would be too painful to do so. Compassion taught us to love all species, all living beings.</p>
<p>When Thay was not away for teaching tours in the US, we were very happy. In those days, Thay often came to Lower Hamlet and taught us the monastic Mindful Manners. Things like, when sweeping the floor, we should not raise the broom too high because doing so would stir up the dust everywhere. Or when eating, we should keep our head straight up and not bent over etc. Thay also taught us how to write poetry. Ms. Tinh Thuy and Brother Vo Ngai were the quickest learners among us. Soon after Thay finished his teaching, they already submitted their newly composed poems. Thay then taught us how to edit their poems to make them rhyme better. Each time Thay came back to Lower Hamlet, we were so happy as if in a festival. These sweet, beautiful memories, they are endless! All of them have nourished my bodhicitta until now.</p>
<p>During the Summer Retreats, so many people came to practice. In the old days, Lower Hamlet was reserved for Vietnamese practitioners. In the first Summer Retreat I joined as a novice nun, my responsibility was to help Sister Chan Khong to organize tea meditation sessions. I checked the registration list and made invitation letters for the tea sessions, and then prepared tea cups and took care of the work of the tea attendant. I did this for the whole Summer Retreat. Besides that, I also helped Ms. Tinh Thuy in the bookshop and joined the cooking team with Thanh Tuyen (now Sr. Huong Nghiem). Having just ordained, how could I know how to cook for that many people? At that time we hosted 60, 70 or even 100 lay friends each week. Before the Summer Retreat, Sister Thanh Luong already trained us in cooking. Which pot should we use to cook for 50 to 100 people? How many knives and cutting boards should we prepare for lay friends to help us cut vegetables during mindful service time? Thanh Tuyen and I were on the same team. We discussed, and planned that we would cook the same dishes every week. We thought that each week new friends would come and no one would know! Only the sisters complained. Sister Chan Vi said, “Every time you two cook, you do the same old thing. Don’t you get bored?” I replied quietly in my head, “Only once a week, how could anyone get bored?” I don’t really remember what dishes they were but I still remember my favorite dish, which was black bean porridge topped with coconut milk and salted roasted-peanuts for the evening meal. I cooked that every week when it was my turn.</p>
<p>There were weeks when many Vietnamese people came. Thanh Tuyen arranged for the aunties (the elder women) to stay in my room. I once shared the room with seven of them. I was quite happy. Sharing the room with them I could listen to their stories about their families and children. I felt very fortunate that I took this path; otherwise I would have suffered as much as they did at the time.</p>
<p>In a little forest near Lower Hamlet there was a long lake with crystal-clear water. The trees in the forest were very beautiful; their branches leaning on one another just like us in the Ssangha. After the Ssummer Rretreat we would normally have a 10-day lazy period. On these lazy days I often packed amy little sac with a piece of bread, a banana, and a thermos filled with hot water. Walking into the woods, I would find a clearing to spread out my sitting mat. I practiced sitting meditation and then ate my lunch there. After that I took a long nap until the afternoon set in, then I cleaned up and went back to the hamlet. My novice nun experience inof the old days was really pure, only practice, nothing else.</p>
<p>In the old days of Plum Village, we only interacted with lay friends who came to practice with us. When they came here they only focused on the practice and followed the schedule. That was why we had very limited contact with the outside world. News of the world about politics or incidents of violence etc. have never once appeared in my mind, let alone my imagining or thinking of them. Each month we received a modest amount of pocket money that was enough to buy personal hygiene items, or a notebook to write down the teachings from Thay, or sometimes a box of LU biscuits, which would be saved for moments of sweet craving. The word “donation” was really foreign and new to me. After so many years staying in Plum Village, I only received a donation one time and the amount was equivalent to 5 or 10 dollars. I always said to myself,: “I didn’t becomebecame a monastic not to receivelook for donations.” Thay taught us in a monastic retreat: The purpose of a monastic is not food and clothing. It is also not to look for material comfort. The practice of Plum Village is to generate happiness.</p>
<p>In the old days when there was no Internet, or iPhones, iPads, computers etc., communication through technology was limited and people did not have manymuch fearsfear or worries. Today however, the more modern and more expansive the communication, the more people like to amass information. Most of the time however, this information brings us worryies and sufferings. Our lives become so busy without a moment of peace.</p>
<p>I still recall the day we celebrated 20 years of Plum Village. When Plum Village was 20 years old, we were a little older in the Dharma and had already received the lamp transmission. At that time, we were like young birds trained to fly from their warm nest.  Thay assigned us with the task of going out to building Plum Village practice centers in Europe, America and Asia.</p>
<p>Now Plum Village is 40 years old and we are also becoming middle aged. Though the phenomenaon of birth and death, of change, are in the historical dimension, it is still time to prepare a place to return to. I always remind myself of that. My younger sister, Sister. Chỉ Nghiêm however, was already ahead of me.</p>
<p>This morning, after many months of battling with cancer, Sisterr. Chỉ Nghiêm waved her last goodbye to the Ssangha amidst the sound of our evoking the Buddha’s names. Conditions have ceased in this lifetime and when they converge again, she will manifest in a new, even more beautiful life.</p>
<p>When Deer Park monastery was founded, Sisterr. Chỉ Nghiêm followed Thay’s instruction to go there first and build it with other sisters. When Blue Cliff was founded, she also volunteered to come here to support building the new Ssangha. She had never let down Thay and the ancestral teachers. In her last moments, she was at peace. Last night in the Purification Ceremony, Venerable Minh Tuan brought a dark yellow paper fan on which was painted a Zen circle with Thay’s calligraphy in it: “My child, smile as you cross to the other shore.”</p>
<p>Walking on the path to the Great Togetherness meditation hall, I saw the monks' residence alight with beautiful colors. Christmas has arrived. My sisters have also turned on decorative lights in our quarters to celebrate Christmas. It feels so alive and joyful as if there had never been a funeral just a few days ago. The light and shade of time!</p>
<p>It seems like only yesterday that I saw Thay sitting on the podium teaching. It seems like only yesterday that I saw myself helping Thay putting down fertilizer for the chrysanthemums. It seems like only yesterday that I saw myself together with athe delegation walking behind Thay, ascending the Vulture Peak within mindful steps… All of that seems like a beautiful dream now. I have to accept the change in order to touch the unchangeable, which isare the love between Thay and his disciples, brotherhood, and sisterhood and, bodhicitta. These will stay dear in my heart forever, in this life and for many lives to come.
