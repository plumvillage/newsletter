<p><strong>There is the Letting Go</strong></p>
<p>There is the letting go</p>
<p>of the song in our hearts</p>
<p>we have kept so long.</p>
<p>There is the letting go</p>
<p>That the trees know</p>
<p>So well, when</p>
<p>Their leaves fly and fall.</p>
<p>There is the letting go</p>
<p>And wishing you well</p>
<p>As streams of life</p>
<p>Flow forward</p>
<p>Leaving spaces</p>
<p>Of memories behind.</p>
<p>There is the letting go</p>
<p>Which is all of life</p>
<p>Disappearing</p>
<p>And reappearing</p>
<p>With the colors and sounds of spring.</p>
<p>This poem was written after the Be-In on 4 December 2021 when we were together with many Sisters who would be leaving New Hamlet in a few days to visit their families in Vietnam,  and then move on to other practice centers. We sang songs to one another and shared from our hearts the beautiful experiences we had at New Hamlet.</p>
<p>It was also the anniversary day of my little brotherâ€™s passing away in 1994. I remember his qualities of courage and freedom. The letting go is part of being able to continue to live after experiencing the death of a beloved one.</p>
