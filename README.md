Single source publishing project using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and [PagedJS](https://www.pagedjs.org/).

## Setup for local development
Run `./setup.sh`

## Running locally
Run `npm start` and browse to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

## Generating PDF files
Run `node generatePDF.js`

## Deployment
Because of the bug that currently sometimes renders 4 columns on first run, its best to have
Eleventy running so you can check if the layout your deploying is correct.

1. Run `npm start`, check if the layout is ok. Trigger a re-render if needed.
2. Run `npm run deploy`

## Code style
- Use hyphenated class names in CSS.

## Bugs & ToDos
 - Images that are rotated with EXIF are not processed correctly, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48716266/sharp-image-library-rotates-image-when-resizing
 - Image processing is not parallel. Makes the first serve very slow.
 - After first starting the server, the result is buggy (propably due to some race condition during image processing). We always need to reload after the first serve is ready.
 - Sometimes paragraphs (and images) do not break correctly to the next page. See BugTextFragment.webp. The fragment ends up in the top right corner (or outside) of the page.
 - Orphans and Widows (css) do not work.
 - H2 are left as the last column element, even though page-break-after: avoid; is set
 - The (in Browser) Print Preview and the actual PDF output from Puppeteer are not identical. the font flows slightly different (e.g. kerning, justification). Very annoying, because I cannot 100% predict the output from the preview. Generally, Puppeteer needs less space.
 - for very large files: ProtocolError: Protocol error (Page.printToPDF): Printing failed
