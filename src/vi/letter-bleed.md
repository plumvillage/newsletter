# since reflowing/tweaking everything to Letter format is a lot of work, we only scale the A4 content to fit into Letter format
# this is achieved by first adding width to A4, such that it has the same page ratio as Letter:
size: "229.5mm 297mm"
# later, in the PDF generation, we uniformly downscale (~94%) to Letter (11"x8.5")

# bleed: 3.175mm =
bleed: "0.125in"
