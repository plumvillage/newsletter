<div class="verse"><p>I am a rainbow, a beautiful stroke of art,<br/>
Overarching Earth in the free sky.</p>

<p>I am here for you!<br/>
I am an object of your mind, and you are an object of my mind,<br/>
We are each other’s.<br/>
Thank you for being here, as you are.<br/>
Without you I couldn’t be.<br/>
You make my life real and beautiful.<br/>
Do you know you can see me this way because you stand where you stand?<br/>
Take a little step to one side, and you may see me differently,<br/>
You might even not see me anymore - we are fragile beings!</p>

<p>I have the blue colour, and I have the pink colour,<br/>
I have both pink and blue – and many other colours.<br/>
In the small blue box in your mind, the one with the blue label,<br/>
I feel a little tight.<br/>
Would you allow me a little bit of pink, too?<br/>
If you have difficulties to accept my pinkness<br/>
While I am in the blue box,<br/>
Remember I am an object of your mind.<br/>
We are not separated: I am this way because you are that way,<br/>
And one can’t avoid oneself.<br/>
I’ll do just the same and listen to what you have to say,<br/>
for your blue box is mine too.<br/>
For your happiness is mine too.<br/>
In fact I am free from all that colour thing, and you too.<br/>
Let us accept pinkness in blue boxes, and such and such,<br/>
It might help both of us feel happier,<br/>
And we’ll be able to enjoy each other.</p>

<p>You may be mostly red, orange, pink, or blue,<br/>
And we both dwell in the same rainbow.<br/>
Between you and I, no real boundaries,<br/>
Look, I send my hand across colours and reach out to you.<br/>
Ha! Look! My hand has the same colour as you!</p>

<p>When sunlight and rain aren’t seen<br/>
What is our colour my dear rainbow?<br/>
The water in us, is it pink, blue, green?<br/>
How about the air, the earth and the heat in us,<br/>
Are they blue, are they pink?<br/>
Looking at ourselves through a Diamond eye,<br/>
What shall we see?<br/>
What is our true colour?</p>

<p>I love to fly in the great sky,<br/>
And swim across from one box to the next!</p>

<p>Most important is to arrive into my body, mind and breath,<br/>
As they unfold in the now.<br/>
Let them decide which color they’ll manifest.<br/>
Coming home to myself and again,<br/>
I get to discover my true self.</p>

<p>A last little thing I’d like to say:<br/>
Holding the flag of inclusiveness,<br/>
Adorning unwavering inclusiveness,<br/>
Whether or not the flag has rainbow colors,<br/>
Healing and peace manifest in this very moment,<br/>
and is communicated to all in the three times.</p>

<p>Thank you, my friends, for being here with me,<br/>
Thanks to you I can enjoy myself and learn to live and to love together.</p></div>
