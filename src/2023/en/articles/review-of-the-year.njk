        In Plum Village France, the multifold sangha gathered at Dharma Cloud Temple on March 5 to receive Thay’s ashes with a solemn ceremony, accompanied by the sound of the Great Temple Bell and the Prajna drums.
        </p><p>On 13 March, we held a 3-day online retreat with over 500 practitioners to honor the 49th day of Thay’s passing. We returned part of Thay’s ashes to the Earth while over 15,000 sangha friends joined online. Holding Thay’s ashes reverently in our palms, we each connected deeply with Thay in our heart.
        </p><p>Then in June and July—together with Thay’s most senior monastic and lay disciples, who came to honor Thay and celebrate 40 Years of Plum Village—we spread Thay’s ashes in the Lower Hamlet and New Hamlet."

The retreats also sprouted new sanghas such as the Wake Up sangha in Bogota. While not all of our monastics spoke the local language, they were able to connect through songs, games, and being present, especially for the children.
        </p><p>The sisters and brothers on tour were beautifully living and touring together, practising the Six Harmonies in action, bringing their harmony and diverse methods of teaching with them. In turn, the happiness they saw among the lay friends was their greatest nourishment."

On the evening of January 9, Plum Village brothers and sisters from around the world sat together with guest monks and nuns to share loving memories of Thay.
</p><p>
January 10 began with silent walking meditation on the grounds of Tu Hieu Temple amidst the cool rain. This was followed by a memorial ceremony led by several venerable monks and nuns who were students of Thay in the 1960s.
</p><p>
The sangha also chanted sutras, practiced Touching the Earth and recited the Five Mindfulness Trainings to cultivate the energy of peace, love, and reverence."
