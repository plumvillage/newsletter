<div class="verse"><p><b>Mountain Dream</b></p>

<p>There are moments, I am mountain,<br/>
standing tall against the wind.<br/>
There are moments, I am water,<br/>
flowing free through the mountain.<br/>
There are moments, I am flower,<br/>
blooming by the water.<br/>
There are moments, I am space,<br/>
silent and ungraspable.<br/>
Be it mountain, be it water<br/>
be it flower, be it space,<br/>
I surrender to the magic of the moment.</p></div>
