<!-- <p class="intro">Some intro text for the article to explain about the question and answer session with the young ones. :)</p> -->

> “Before ordaining, I lacked confidence when I smiled. When I met someone and smiled, there was something in me that made me feel insecure. After becoming a nun, I’ve had the chance to live more naturally. Now, my smile comes from the peace and joy in my heart, and it is very natural. 
> 
> I also train to see things more positively. In the sangha, we come from many different regions, countries, and cultures. Naturally, friction occurs sometimes. I practice to look into myself first so that I am not caught up in those frictions. Or, I find ways to make the issue smaller, and I notice how much lighter I feel.”<cite>Sr. An Niem</cite>

> “When I was a lay person, I spoke very little, even though my work was in management. I communicated very briefly, and sometimes felt nervous to share. When I became a monk, I began to practice loving speech. I started feeling more inner space and time to say what I wanted to say. In this way, my words now contain more love and understanding.”<cite>Br. Ruong Hieu</cite>

<h3 class="young-ones-center-heading">What is a positive habit<br/>that you have developed<br/>since entering the sangha?</h2>

> “When there is an emotion coming up, I like to recognise it, and take time to sit with it, acknowledge it and embrace it for a few minutes. I don’t want to move onto something else too quickly anymore. Otherwise, I know that this emotion will ‘follow’ me for hours. I prefer to take care of it right away and re-establish inner peace as soon as I can.”<cite>Br. Thien Y</cite>

> “After ordaining, I felt I didn’t need to rush anymore. In the past, I was always rushing: to work, to do this and that, running after time. Now, first thing in the morning, I just drink a cup of tea with my brothers. No need to rush anymore - just drinking our tea, being relaxed, being together. Sitting like that, in silence, I find it a very healing time for myself.”<cite>Br. Ruong Duc</cite>

> “Before becoming a nun, I had the tendency to walk very fast, to save time. I worked as a nurse, and had to prepare the necessary tools before the doctors arrived, taking care of patients and their families. When I first entered the temple, everyone said I flew as I walked! So my first lesson was learning to walk.
> 
> At the start it was really difficult for me. I was used to walking fast and didn’t know how to be aware of the body or hear the sound of my footsteps rushing. I had the idea that the elder sisters were watching me and would give me reminders. So if an elder sister walked in front, I walked behind; if she took one path, I took another. I was hiding! I felt like a train being halted.
> 
> After a while, I began to see myself as a baby learning to walk, to balance herself. Practicing like that, I knew better how to stop. When there is a lot of work or something urgent to do, I notice old habits coming back, so I try to slow down and have more understanding.”<cite>Sr. Tuong Niem</cite>
