<!-- <p class="intro">Some intro text for the article to explain about the question and answer session with the young ones. :)</p> -->


> “The mindful manner on ‘receiving a reminder with joined palms, saying thank you.’ I found it so simple, and yet so liberating. Outside, in the workplace, if anyone reminds you, they expect a quick reply, something back. But in the monastery, the person who is receiving a reminder can have a lot of freedom and insight.
> 
> Firstly, I try to receive any reminder with a lot of gratitude, because the other person had the courage and compassion to share something difficult. Afterwards, even if I totally disagreed in the beginning, I wait a few days to check inside, ‘is it true?’ By not reacting emotionally, remaining humble, sometimes I discover how that feedback was right. Then, I reflect that without this mindful manner, I would never have seen that about myself.”<cite>Br. Thien Y</cite>

> “For me, not drinking alcohol. It’s not that I did it often, but sometimes I did. Now, after a long time of not doing that, I can compare then and now. I can see how much freedom there is in not being in that state of mind, where I wouldn’t have much control over what happened to my body and mind.
> 
> Also, our precept on chastity makes me feel free to interact with clarity with others, knowing where I stand in any relationship. This way, I feel free to direct my energy onto the spiritual path.”<cite>Br. Niem Thuan</cite>
 
> “Working together with the Sangha, as an organism, makes me feel free from individual concerns, and I can enjoy working with more ease.”<cite>Sr. Lam Hy</cite>
 
<h2 class="young-ones-center-heading">What is the mindful manner that gives you the most freedom, and why?</h2>

> The mindful manner about sharing a room helped me to become more aware of others’ needs - which are often different from mine. More and more, I am learning to interact, to double check, and to hear what is said and what is not being said - something I find so interesting.”<cite>Br. Dinh Tuc</cite>
 
> “Mindful cooking. While I work, I can be aware of my breathing, of what I am doing, of the thoughts and speech I produce… being aware of what I am doing clearly, I feel very free and joyful.”<cite>Br. Ruong Duc</cite>

> “The practice of knocking three times before entering a room, helps me to stop. Before, I used to knock as if I wanted to bring down the door! Then, I started to practice the mindful manner, but only the outer form, like a robot. However, day by day, that practice has become a very beautiful new habit. I enjoyed seeing this practice bloom naturally, without having to feel forced.
> 
> Also, there are always people coming and going in the Sangha, and this practice of knocking has become my way of acknowledging the person whose room I am entering, to really cherish every relationship.”<cite>Sr. Tuong Niem</cite>
 
> “I really like all the mindful manners. I like very much how they create harmony among us, and that is a kind of freedom already, because it makes me feel more at ease. I also feel safe, knowing all my brothers and sisters practice the mindful manners and precepts. This is also a kind of freedom, to feel safe and spacious.”<cite>Br. Niem Xa</cite>

> “I like to practice not chatting while working. I can feel the energy of stopping and calming in my heart, and I can contemplate more clearly my body and mind.”<cite>Sr. An Niem</cite>

> “Bowing. When I had some relationship problems, I still practiced bowing, and recited the Gatha ‘A lotus for you, a Buddha to be.’ It was not easy, but I chose to keep practising it fully. Slowly, I found more freedom, more insight: I saw our ancestors practicing together with us, in us. Finally, we could reconcile and begin anew, and I recognised how freeing this practice of cultivating openness had been to me.”<cite>Sr. Hien Tam</cite>
