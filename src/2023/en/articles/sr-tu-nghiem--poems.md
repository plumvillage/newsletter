<p><b>There’s a Song in My Heart</b></p>

<p>Everything is frozen<br/>
and the garden is still.<br/>
Only dogs bark.</p>

<p>But the sun has risen,<br/>
and the curtain<br/>
of cold clouds<br/>
holds back her light.</p>

<p>Be patient, my friend.<br/>
Her warmth will<br/>
melt the cold arms of winter.</p>

<p>Everything is frozen<br/>
and the garden is still.<br/>
There’s a song in my heart<br/>
For them who will listen</p>

<p>To the stars’ lullaby<br/>
Streaming down<br/>
from the heavens:</p>

<p>“The Boat continues<br/>
 in the waters of life.</p>
 
<p>People get on and get off,<br/>
and the Boat continues<br/>
in the waters of life.</p>

<p>Waves crash and slam,<br/>
yet the Boat continues<br/>
in the waters of life.</p>

<p>Multitudes are smiling as<br/>
the Boat continues<br/>
in the waters of life</p>

<p><b>Little Asparagus Trees</b></p>

<p>Little asparagus trees,<br/>
The raindrops quench<br/>
Your thirst<br/>
For survival.</p>

These two poems were written during the late autumn when the weather became very cold.

There is an asparagus farm, across the road from us at New Hamlet, and our neighbor farmers let their asparagus plants grow up tall so that eventually they look like little delicate brown trees with gossamer branches. It was very dry this fall with little rain, but one day it rained, and the raindrops fell on the tiny asparagus “trees”. And the raindrops nourished the soil they were in and they could survive.

One morning it was -5 degrees Celsius and I saw that the garden was frozen overnight. Everything was very still in the freezing air. But I know that the sun always rises and warms up the air later on. I was reflecting on the Sangha, and how Thay taught us that the Sangha is our Boat, always carrying us, and supporting us as we are engaged here and in the world with our practice, and with the Fourteen Mindfulness Trainings.

The Sangha is the boat always continuing to move forward. Over many centuries people have come and gone, but the practice of the teachings has continued even in world situations of war, hatred and violence. And thousands of people who have received and are practicing Thay’s teachings, and are following the Bodhisattva path, are able to smile at life, knowing we will be able to reach the other shore of transforming suffering by living the truth of interbeing with love and understanding in the present moment.
