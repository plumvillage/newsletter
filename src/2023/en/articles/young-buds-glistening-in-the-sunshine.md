<p class="intro">Some intro text for the article to explain about the question and answer session with the young ones. :)</p>

> “Before ordaining, I lacked confidence when I smiled. When I met someone and smiled, there was something in me that made me feel insecure. After becoming a nun, I’ve had the chance to live more naturally. Now, my smile comes from the peace and joy in my heart, and it is very natural. 
> 
> I also train to see things more positively. In the sangha, we come from many different regions, countries, and cultures. Naturally, friction occurs sometimes. I practice to look into myself first so that I am not caught up in those frictions. Or, I find ways to make the issue smaller, and I notice how much lighter I feel.”<cite>Sr. An Niem</cite>

> “When I was a lay person, I spoke very little, even though my work was in management. I communicated very briefly, and sometimes felt nervous to share. When I became a monk, I began to practice loving speech. I started feeling more inner space and time to say what I wanted to say. In this way, my words now contain more love and understanding.”<cite>Br. Ruong Hieu</cite>

<h2 class="young-ones-center-heading">What is a positive habit that you have developed since entering the Sangha?</h2>

> “When there is an emotion coming up, I like to recognise it, and take time to sit with it, acknowledge it and embrace it for a few minutes. I don’t want to move onto something else too quickly anymore. Otherwise, I know that this emotion will ‘follow’ me for hours. I prefer to take care of it right away and re-establish inner peace as soon as I can.”<cite>Br. Thien Y</cite>

> “After ordaining, I felt I didn’t need to rush anymore. In the past, I was always rushing: to work, to do this and that, running after time. Now, first thing in the morning, I just drink a cup of tea with my brothers. No need to rush anymore - just drinking our tea, being relaxed, being together. Sitting like that, in silence, I find it a very healing time for myself.”<cite>Br. Ruong Duc</cite>

> “Before becoming a nun, I had the tendency to walk very fast, to save time. I worked as a nurse, and had to prepare the necessary tools before the doctors arrived, taking care of patients and their families. When I first entered the temple, everyone said I flew as I walked! So my first lesson was learning to walk.
> 
> At the start it was really difficult for me. I was used to walking fast and didn’t know how to be aware of the body or hear the sound of my footsteps rushing. I had the idea that the elder sisters were watching me and would give me reminders. So if an elder sister walked in front, I walked behind; if she took one path, I took another. I was hiding! I felt like a train being halted.
> 
> After a while, I began to see myself as a baby learning to walk, to balance herself. Practicing like that, I knew better how to stop. When there is a lot of work or something urgent to do, I notice old habits coming back, so I try to slow down and have more understanding.”<cite>Sr. Tuong Niem</cite>

    {% image "article2023/young-ones/Mindful Manner Question.png" %}
</div>

> “The mindful manner on ‘receiving a reminder with joined palms, saying thank you.’ I found it so simple, and yet so liberating. Outside, in the workplace, if anyone reminds you, they expect a quick reply, something back. But in the monastery, the person who is receiving a reminder can have a lot of freedom and insight.
> 
> Firstly, I try to receive any reminder with a lot of gratitude, because the other person had the courage and compassion to share something difficult. Afterwards, even if I totally disagreed in the beginning, I wait a few days to check inside, ‘is it true?’ By not reacting emotionally, remaining humble, sometimes I discover how that feedback was right. Then, I reflect that without this mindful manner, I would never have seen that about myself.”<cite>Br. Thien Y</cite>

> “For me, not drinking alcohol. It’s not that I did it often, but sometimes I did. Now, after a long time of not doing that, I can compare then and now. I can see how much freedom there is in not being in that state of mind, where I wouldn’t have much control over what happened to my body and mind.
> 
> Also, our precept on chastity makes me feel free to interact with clarity with others, knowing where I stand in any relationship. This way, I feel free to direct my energy onto the spiritual path.”<cite>Br. Niem Thuan</cite>
 
> “Working together with the Sangha, as an organism, makes me feel free from individual concerns, and I can enjoy working with more ease.”<cite>Sr. Lam Hy</cite>
 
<h2 class="young-ones-center-heading">What is the mindful manner that gives you the most freedom, and why?</h2>

> The mindful manner about sharing a room helped me to become more aware of others’ needs - which are often different from mine. More and more, I am learning to interact, to double check, and to hear what is said and what is not being said - something I find so interesting.”<cite>Br. Dinh Tuc</cite>
 
> “Mindful cooking. While I work, I can be aware of my breathing, of what I am doing, of the thoughts and speech I produce… being aware of what I am doing clearly, I feel very free and joyful.”<cite>Br. Ruong Duc</cite>

> “The practice of knocking three times before entering a room, helps me to stop. Before, I used to knock as if I wanted to bring down the door! Then, I started to practice the mindful manner, but only the outer form, like a robot. However, day by day, that practice has become a very beautiful new habit. I enjoyed seeing this practice bloom naturally, without having to feel forced.
> 
> Also, there are always people coming and going in the Sangha, and this practice of knocking has become my way of acknowledging the person whose room I am entering, to really cherish every relationship.”<cite>Sr. Tuong Niem</cite>
 
> “I really like all the mindful manners. I like very much how they create harmony among us, and that is a kind of freedom already, because it makes me feel more at ease. I also feel safe, knowing all my brothers and sisters practice the mindful manners and precepts. This is also a kind of freedom, to feel safe and spacious.”<cite>Br. Niem Xa</cite>

> “I like to practice not chatting while working. I can feel the energy of stopping and calming in my heart, and I can contemplate more clearly my body and mind.”<cite>Sr. An Niem</cite>

> “Bowing. When I had some relationship problems, I still practiced bowing, and recited the Gatha ‘A lotus for you, a Buddha to be.’ It was not easy, but I chose to keep practising it fully. Slowly, I found more freedom, more insight: I saw our ancestors practicing together with us, in us. Finally, we could reconcile and begin anew, and I recognised how freeing this practice of cultivating openness had been to me.”<cite>Sr. Hien Tam</cite>

    {% image "article2023/young-ones/Elder One Question.png" %}
</div>

> “A heart of service brimming with enthusiasm and sincerity. Some elder sisters have inspired me, and given me plenty of inspiration to practice in this way.”<cite>Sr. An Niem</cite>

> “Sometimes I feel ‘small’ when talking to some elder siblings. I find it really cool when there is one who talks to me in a respectful and open way, that it shakes me out of that ‘role’ of the younger one. There is something in their energy of listening that makes me feel heard, that my opinion is important. I had some organising team members and mentors who embody that spirit, and I really try to bring it with me - for example in a cooking team, asking others for their input, and seeing their surprise and sense of self-worth being re-kindled.”<cite>Br. Thien Y</cite>
 
> “On another note, I really appreciate seeing an elder one follow the schedule. It makes me feel that I can do the same as I grow up; that I don’t need to sacrifice those moments of happiness, of practice. It makes me feel happy about my future.
> 
> Having someone who allows me to grow, to make mistakes, to not be perfect. Anyway, one day, we’ll be able to do it in a way people call ‘perfect’, but there’s no need to rush in that process! For me, learning in a slow, kind and compassionate way is very important, and my mentor has the capacity to be there for me in that spirit.”<cite>Sr. Xuan Hanh</cite>
 
> “When I can see their practice, I am impressed by their way of daily living. I am really inspired by that kind of presence, cultivating more ‘being’ rather than knowledge.”<cite>Br. Niem Xa</cite>

<h2 class="young-ones-center-heading">What is the quality you appreciate the most in an elder brother or sister, and why?</h2>
 
> “For me, I appreciate when they have some stability and commitment to the teachings of Thay. Then, I feel I can learn a lot from them, from their teachings and experiences. In particular, how they went through a difficulty: even if in that moment it doesn’t help me, if I have a similar suffering in the future, I will be able to relate to it.”<cite>Br. Niem Thuan</cite>
 
> “Kindness and openness. For example, as an aspirant once I had to invite the activity bell, but I didn’t know I had to wear the long robe for that. One sister came around, and just said to me ‘oh, let me do it for you’ - without any judgement. I felt it was such a nice way of showing the path, without saying ‘you should do this’, but rather by example and as a kind offering.”<cite>Sr. Lam Hy</cite>

> “For me, it is their acceptance. When I entered the temple, I brought all my difficulties along with me, and there are some I cannot practice with yet. The elder sisters have given me a great deal of space, patiently waiting for me to practice. And they are always ready to be present, to guide me. This makes me feel at home.”<cite>Sr. Tuong Niem</cite>
 
> “I know everyone comes from different walks of life, that people grow up in different cultures, and have different aspirations. I really appreciate an elder when they can embrace all of these cultures; they may have strong self-discipline, but at the same time they can be very flexible for others. They understand the essence of Plum Village practice, and how to apply it in modern times. I think those aspects have to go together: understanding the younger siblings, and understanding the world.”<cite>Sr. Hieu Duc</cite>

> “When I have the chance to live closely with my elder sisters, I can feel their love, especially from those who had directly received the guidance and love of Thay. They have such great love for the sangha. They always wish to transmit the practices and words of advice from Thay to the younger ones who don’t have the chance to be with Thay. That is truly the beauty of sisterly love in one family. The elder ones give the younger ones all their love, care, and encouragement. Therefore, I also feel that I need to be responsible and to practice well so that I do not let down my elder sisters.”<cite>Sr. Tam Duc</cite>
