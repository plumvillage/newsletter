<div class="verse"><p><b>This Path</b></p>

<p>Because I chose this path<br/>
there is calmness.</p>

<p>Because there is calmness<br/>
something can grow.</p>

<p>A tiny seed, buried in the soil,<br/>
silently stretching out its roots<br/>
—a trust beyond lifetimes.</p>

<p>There has to be a winter first<br/>
before welcoming the spring.</p></div>

<div class="verse"><p><b>When we are gone</b></p>

<p>Who will look at the stars<br/>
and witness the sunrise?</p>

<p>Who will listen to the wind<br/>
in the trees and the owl?</p>

<p>Who will smell the honeysuckle<br/>
and feel the cat in your lap?</p>

<p>Who will write poetry?</p>

<p>No one to cry, to laugh,<br/>
to feel the intense beauty and the pain.</p>

<p>Being alive is not a small thing.</p></div>
