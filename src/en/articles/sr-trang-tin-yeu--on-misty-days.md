<div class="verse"><p>On misty days,<br/>
We cannot see much, except the beauty of the mist itself.<br/>
On misty days,<br/>
We cannot hear much, except the depth of silence.<br/>
On misty days,<br/>
We cannot feel much, except the sacred stillness.</p>

<p>On your departure Thay, these beautiful misty days in Plum Village,<br/>
are sending us deep silence and stillness.<br/>
Did you choose this day Thay?<br/>
Or did Mother Earth choose it for you? Or choose for us?</p>

<p>You often reminded us that all seasons are beautiful.<br/>
If we can have silence within, silence from all the noise in our mind,<br/>
We can listen and enjoy all the wonders of life in every moment.</p>

<p>On your departure Thay, you bathed our minds with deep silence,<br/>
So we can listen carefully to you, to your fullest being and eternal teachings.</p>

<p>We listen to our pain, grief and sadness.<br/>
As you said it is also your pain, grief and sadness.<br/>
We listen to your promise that you will return as soon as possible.<br/>
And yes, you have kept your promise,<br/>
As you said that you are not limited by your physical body.</p>

<p>Our pain, grief and sadness<br/>
have become an awakening force<br/>
To look attentively at<br/>
Your aspiration body,<br/>
Your Dharma body,<br/>
Your consciousness body,<br/>
Your compassionate body<br/>
To help countless people to suffer less.</p>

<p>We carefully collect all the beautiful seeds<br/>
That you have planted inside of us.<br/>
We want to keep them tightly so they won’t get lost.<br/>
We want to take care of them as a great treasure.<br/>
We want to grow them tirelessly<br/>
So we can bring you alive in every cell of our body.<br/>
In every step and every breath.</p>

<p>Only in this way,<br/>
Our pain, grief and sadness<br/>
are lessened and we can be at ease<br/>
and transformed into a source<br/>
of endless gratitude, love and awakening.</p></div>

Thank You Thay
Sister Tin Yêu
