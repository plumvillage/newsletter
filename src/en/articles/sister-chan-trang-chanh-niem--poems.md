## Here

> A slip of light <br/>
> let insight ignite <br/>
> the darkness of night.<br/>
> Our hands call to the same bell,<br/>
> pools of sound resound <br/>
> throughout infinity<br/>

## Sometimes

> Sometimes I am like<br/>
> a big eye<br/>
> looking at myself.<br/>
> It gets hot<br/>
> There is pain<br/>
> the mind is splintered -<br/>
> has run away from itself again<br/>
> and needs to be called back,<br/>
> to sink back,<br/>
> and down it falls into the earth<br/>
> of being<br/>
> which is in this body,<br/>
> in the bones and soft movements<br/>
> whole<br/>
> whole again, and<br/>
> home<br/>
