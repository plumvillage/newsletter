## Workshops on the Environment 

I love Mother earth, and I cannot look at documentaries on the environment crisis without feeling despair and powerlessness. It was with this backdrop that a chain of events happened which empowered me not to give up hope but to do what we can, where we are, with what we have got, to help Mother earth. Perhaps Mother earth can be a verb as well as a noun, perhaps we have to nurture and care for the land that is looking up at us needing our love.

During the Rains retreat of 2019 we had a series of workshops on the environment to see how we could reduce our carbon footprint and recycling, which completely changed the way I saw rubbish. As part of the workshops we started looking at what we were throwing out to see how we could reduce our carbon footprint and the amount of waste we were exporting out of the monastery. The mindset we had at the time was to take everything to the recycling centre by van. We didn’t give much thought to what happened to it next. It was someone else’s problem.

The workshops showed us what happened next, and so we saw that vast amounts of things are not recycled and saw a documentary about a Japanese town that had achieved zero waste through the collective efforts of the whole community. They had succeeded in building a collective recycling centre that tried to re-use everything. are buried in the earth in huge pits. Even things that are recycled are not processed locally but are transported on to other larger plants, creating more carbon. Therefore it seemed clear that by looking into what we could process here ourselves we would reduce a whole chain of transport by fossil fuel burning vehicles but also reduce the amount of stuff buried in the earth.

When we study the ten links we see that through our ignorance we see things as separate formations and we do not see the interrelation between things. We see a log on the fire but we do not see the chainsaw that cut it up or the fossil fuels burnt in that cutting action. We see a tee-shirt but not the amount of water that was used to make it. It is also easy for us to get rid of things and not concern ourselves about what will become of them or our planet as a result. Can we see the future of the packaging of items we order or buy in the shop? It is hard to include its continuation in our choice of each item. 

## Harvesting rainwater 

During those workshops we had one group focus on water and how much water we use unnecessarily. Our revolution began right there. I slowly began to notice that we had several large rainwater collectors lying around and not being used. Little by little we started collecting them to gutters and before long we had 5 rainwater collectors harvesting a total of 2,500 litres of rainwater. It cost us almost nothing just our labour since we had pipes salvaged from reconstruction projects. 

With this in place, we noticed that once the containers were full we could not harvest any more rainwater next time it rained. Around the same time we started to buy cooking oil in 25litre plastic containers and they eventually started arriving in recycling. So we began cleaning them and filling them from the rainwater collectors. Our rainwater tanks became rain cows that we could endlessly milk. 

What are we doing with all that water? If you are planting trees it is very convenient to have lots of portable containers of water. Also we have an outside tap next to the monastic residence. Son Ha is at the bottom of a hill and gets very muddy when the rains come. The brothers were using this outside tap to wash the mud off their boots after walking. So we put one rainwater collector there with a tap and now we use the rainwater to clean our boots so we save on tapwater.

Two other collectors were set up to take the run off rainwater from our barn’s roof. We use this to process our waste cardboard and to water the flowers in the garden.

## Driving less 

When we looked at what kind of waste we were driving in our fossil fuel burning van to the local recycling centre we found that it was mostly cardboard and glass. Not only were we driving this cardboard and glass to the recycling centre while burning diesel, but it was not being processed there. So it would all go on another fossil fuel burning journey to a bigger centre to be processed. I like cycling and decided to cycle all the glass up to the nearby bottle bank in Puyguilhem at the top of the hill. This is good for my health, good for the environment and empowering me to feel I am doing something to help.

## Composting and making cardboard logs 

Now we shred some of the cardboard by hand and add it to weeds or grass cuttings to make a rich compost which we store in empty rice sacks of which we have a regular supply from the garden. Witnessing this alchemy of turning grass and cardboard to air the mix and seeing the red worms come and eventually the pile transformed into dark brown compost is very fulfilling.

The wastepaper and unglossy cardboard are cut up and soaked in rainwater before being pulped, mixed with sawdust from our woodwork area and compressed into logs for the fire. It can be difficult sometimes to get everyone on board with the idea that separating sawdust from other floor sweepings is helping the environment. But patience pays off. We made the log press from an old car jack and bits of scrap metal. 

At first the logs were too long so they either bent over or comically slumped in the drying process. Actually when I think back the very first ones I made were so small it took too much effort to make them for the end result, so that’s why I started making them longer. In addition they are so fragile while still wet, that I broke many just turning them over through their drying stage. Gradually we found the best length to diameter ratio to make them efficient to make and able to manoeuvre and dry naturally in wind and sun. The learning and correcting process was frustrating at the time but also empowering.

This synergy of rainwater harvesting, and cardboard, sawdust and garden waste recycling turns a lot of waste into useful things, keeps us warm and helps us grow trees and plants. We also reduce the amount of wooden logs we need and thereby the amount of chainsaw use and produce less smoke particles from our chimneys. Also the seasons affect everything so it’s harder to make compost in midwinter as there is no green stuff to mix in and the temperature is cold. In autumn the rains make it very easy.

## Repurposing containers – Introducing the tetrapot 

For two years we struggled to find a solution to the vast numbers of tetrapaks we were putting into our yellow recycling bags. Looking deeply into the problem we saw that a third of the volume of our yellow recycling bags was taken up by tetrapaks from vegan milk. We cannot crush them as the recycling centre can only process them uncrushed. From time to time I would try to think of a solution to this issue - sometimes quite laughable ideas, but always in vain. Eventually I kept this problem in the back of my mind waiting for the answer to come.

One day we were invited to help plant pumpkin seeds on our organic farm. We were planting the seeds into fragile unrecyclable black plastic pots. They kept breaking as we put the compost in. There was the solution! – if we cut a tetrapak in half and make a hole in the bottom half we have two planting pots which we had been buying, and they can be used more than once. The Happy farm were keen to try it out as an experiment and so a new life was given to thousands of tetrapaks we use every year. We are also using them to plant many different trees. The tetrapot was born!

With every project there are teething problems. We have to clean the pots really thoroughly as rodents are attracted to traces of milk in the pots and are very happy to munch big holes in the sides of our pots. We have to ask everyone not to crush the tetrapaks. As for all the lids they are the subject of a future recycling project.

## From waste to resource 

What we are discovering is that once you start to look at things not as waste but as a potential resource you create the conditions for finding what that resource will be useful for. It has been hugely empowering to see what we, a small community, can do for the environment using only what we have to hand. The revolution continues.

At the moment it is very clear to me that we need to separate more stuff in bins. Our ability to repurpose waste revolves around it being separated. This is unpopular as it means we have to think more about where to put each waste item. However, it is the only way we have found to practice recycling and repurposing. Our online shop for example has to send all its products by mail. So we started a new bin just for cardboard envelopes and bubblewrap envelopes. Now that all goes to the online shop for re-use. Without the extra bin it’s not easy. 

We are lucky in our community to have a lot of different functions; farm, office, shop etc. But wherever we live we are part of a wider community where these functions exist. We receive wooden crates from vegetables for example. Originally I cut them up in a table saw to make kindling for the fire. Then a brother shared about taking them to a local grower. So now we take them to a local market garden for re-use. That way they buy less new ones. So some stuff gets repurposed here and some is done outside here. We just keep looking out for opportunities and the mind of recycling develops naturally.
