During the Rains’ Retreat 2021, my brothers would often see me mixing a grayish dust with water in an old pot and then pouring the mixture into a small blue bucket. EventuallyFinally, I would return to the monastic residence with something in my hands, much to their curiosity. I did this every day for the 90-days of the Rains’ Retreat.

## My mission

I was pouring cement Buddhas everyday during the 90-days Rains’ Retreat. I set out to make 90 Buddhas, one on each day of the retreat and to give them to our lay friends as a gift at the end of it. I decided to do this because I love Buddha statues. I just have fun with the mud and a mold I made to cast the Buddhas. When I take a Buddha out of the mold, I have a very happy feeling. It’s a bit like becoming a father. I am very focused on the job and my mind comes to rest. At the end of each day I hold a Buddha in my hands and I take it back to the residence feeling very satisfied. I really enjoy it. 

## Giving away Buddhas

I decided to give the Buddhas away as whenever I see a Buddha, I calm down and start smiling. Automatically! I have also observed that many other people have a similar experience. So, the idea to make Buddhas and to give them away was born in me. I want more people to see Buddhas and feel happy. In these difficult times with contact restrictions and mask requirements, this action can help to put a smile on people's faces. Actually, I would love to have one for everyone. To give each person a Buddha to be able to see that they are happy for a moment. I am sure if there were more Buddha statues in the world, more people would feel happy and behave more peacefully. I have set out to make 100,000 Buddha statues. Let's see if I can do it in this life. In any case, it cannot be achieved with my current resources, but let’s see what happens, maybe there will be a solution!

## Would you like a Buddha statue from Brother Dao Quang?

<!-- Is it a good idea to put his email address in? -->

Anyone can ask me, monastics and lay friends. At the moment my capacity is limited to one figure a day because I have only one mold. You don't need to give me anything. No donation is required. Please give the Buddha a nice home or give it away as a present to a loved one. They are weather- and frost- proof. If you don't like the color, you can also paint it. If you like, you can send me a photo of it. You can reach me at *daoquang@plumvillage.org*.
