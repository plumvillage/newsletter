<p class="editors-preface">We have been receiving an outpouring of love from the global community, offering tributes to our teacher. We offer a selection of tributes from notable figures below.</p>

> “In his peaceful opposition to the Vietnam war, his support for Martin Luther King and most of all his dedication to sharing with others not only how mindfulness and compassion contribute to inner peace, but also how individuals cultivating peace of mind contributes to genuine world peace, the Venerable lived a truly meaningful life.”<cite><b>His Holiness the 14<sup>th</sup> Dalai Lama</b></cite>

> “The government hopes that the Plum Village community will continue the Zen master’s vision and aspiration for engaged Buddhism, and so contribute to the prosperity of society, and, together with the wider Buddhist community in Vietnam and abroad, promote peace in the world.”<cite><b>President Nguyen Xuan Phuc and Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh of Vietnam</b></cite>

> “Thich Nhat Hanh will be most remembered for his tireless championing of religious freedom, human rights, non-violence, and his message of mindfulness in daily life.  Although Thay’s influence spread well beyond the realm of religion, he leaves a legacy as one of the most influential religious leaders in recent history.  Thay is probably best remembered as a leading light in interfaith and interreligious dialogue.”<cite><b>US Embassy in Vietnam</b></cite>

> “Thich Nhat Hanh influenced me and so many others by blending his unique approach to mindfulness with a fierce commitment to social justice.

> “Having Thay as a brother and friend, was one of the greatest gifts in my life.

> “From Thay (“teacher,” in Vietnamese) I learned much but perhaps the most important was the skill of deep listening as an avenue to conflict resolution, helping to melt away countless political barriers in the negotiations. His insights and practices helped to open a new fertile space of collaboration through which governments were able to come to the historic agreement.”<cite><b>Christiana Figueres</b>, former Executive Secretary of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change and a student of Thich Nhat Hanh</cite>

> “Thich Nhat Hanh had a dramatic influence on me. He once asked me, ‘What is more important, being successful or being happy?’ I thought ‘both!’ But he said, ‘You have to choose—you can be a victim of your success but you can never be a victim of your happiness.’”<cite><b>Marc Benioff</b>, Salesforce CEO</cite>

> “Thich Nhat Hanh was the most influential Buddhist teacher of the past fifty years.
