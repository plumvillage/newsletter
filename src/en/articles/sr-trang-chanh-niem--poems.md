<div class="verse" id="poem-sometimes"><p><b>Sometimes</b></p>

<p>Sometimes I am like<br/>
a big eye<br/>
looking at myself.<br/>
It gets hot.<br/>
There is pain,<br/>
the mind is splintered -<br/>
has run away from itself again<br/>
and needs to be called back,<br/>
to sink back,<br/>
and down it falls into the earth<br/>
of being<br/>
which is in this body,<br/>
in the bones and soft movements<br/>
whole<br/>
whole again, and<br/>
home.</p></div>


<div class="verse" id="poem-here"><p><b>Here</b></p>

<p>A slip of light<br/>
let insight ignite<br/>
the darkness of night.<br/>
Our hands call to the same bell,<br/>
pools of sound resound<br/>
throughout infinity.</p></div>
