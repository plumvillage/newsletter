## Here

<div class="verse"><p>A slip of light <br/>
let insight ignite <br/>
the darkness of night.<br/>
Our hands call to the same bell<br/>
pools of sound resound <br/>
throughout infinity</p></div>

## Sometimes

<div class="verse"><p>Sometimes I am like<br/>
a big eye<br/>
looking at myself.<br/>
It gets hot<br/>
There is pain<br/>
the mind is splintered -<br/>
has run away from itself again<br/>
and needs to be called back,<br/>
to sink back,<br/>
and down it falls into the earth<br/>
of being<br/>
which is in this body,<br/>
in the bones and soft movements<br/>
whole<br/>
whole again, and<br/>
home</p></div>
