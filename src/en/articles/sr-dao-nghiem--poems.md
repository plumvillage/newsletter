<div class="verse"><p>Snow falling, Autumn!<br/>
Embarking on a journey<br/>
of silence and joy.</p></div>

This poem was written in November, 2002 when I was living in Upstate NewYork and dreaming about traveling to Plum Village to meet Thay. I had started reading books written by Thay in 2000 and came for my first retreat in Plum Village in February 2002.

<div class="verse"><p>To distant lands I left,<br/>
walking step by step on life's path.<br/>
With simple words written on white paper<br/>
you called me at a certain time.<br/>
I found you in the land of my ancestors<br/>
and the day your gaze penetrated my being,<br/>
deep in my heart, I recognised you.<br/>
Since that magical moment,<br/>
time no longer exists<br/>
and my life has become millions of lives.<br/>
All the flowers sway gently and smile at me.<br/>
Your diamond eyes cut and sever<br/>
all the ties that keep me tied,<br/>
one by one with the greatest tenderness<br/>
helping me to reach the place in my heart<br/>
that has eternally existed.<br/>
Thank you my beloved teacher.</p></div>

When I made my decision to ordain in May 2003 I wrote this poem. The first time I saw Thay I knew Thay was the teacher I had been searching for for all my life. I had left France in 1982 to live in a spiritual community in the U.S.A and Canada. I did not return to live in France until 2003 when I was ordained in the Plum Village tradition.

<div class="verse"><p>A rose in my hand, my heart wide open, I walk.<br/>
Each step is imprinted in the earth,<br/>
sending messages of peace to the whole universe.<br/>
Determined, I make the request<br/>
to dedicate my life to relieving suffering.<br/>
Bowing to you, my teacher, I offer you a rose,<br/>
a symbol of love in my being.<br/>
I am determined to continue to walk this way,<br/>
opening my arms to life,<br/>
opening my heart to others,<br/>
opening my eyes to truly see,<br/>
letting my senses reveal their magnificence.<br/>
My mind is calm and serene.<br/>
My life is simple and in harmony with the<br/>
whole universe.<br/>
I cultivate the garden of my heart,<br/>
joy, peace, and love<br/>
so that I can offer her flowers to all beings.<br/>
My mind is open.<br/>
Living in the present moment, I have no regrets<br/>
or thoughts of the future.<br/>
I am filled with enthusiasm and practice with all my heart.<br/>
Every day I recognise everything that life gives me<br/>
as a wonderful gift and am filled with gratitude.<br/>
On the ocean of life I undergo many transformations.<br/>
Great serenity and joy are present.<br/>
The beauty of nature, the changing color of the clouds,<br/>
the smile of a child, the magic of life.<br/>
Gratitude in my heart for all my ancestors,<br/>
for all they have accomplished,<br/>
allowing me to be what I am today.<br/>
Gratitude for the beauty of life.</p></div>

Written in 2003. A week before we ordain we have a ceremony formally requesting to receive the ten novice precepts. During this ceremony we offer a rose to Thay and to our spiritual ancestors. This poem expresses how I felt during that ceremony, my deep aspiration and the love in my being.

<!-- <div class="verse"><p>A cup of steaming tea<br/>
a lighted candle<br/>
a pen writing these lines<br/>
a dream from a few years ago<br/>
written at the bottom of a letter that comes true<br/>
"a cup of tea in your company"<br/>
a cup of tea filled with clouds<br/>
your legacy.</p></div>

This poem was written for Thay in September 2011 -->

<div class="verse"><p>At the death of my ancestors I shed tears of despair<br/>
With mindfulness they have become a source of happiness<br/>
where I stop to drink.<br/>
In the silence I listen to the soft murmur of her melody<br/>
And in letting go I discover, with joy, Life.<br/>
In my steps I found my father<br/>
A river became my mother<br/>
My sister opened my heart and made my fear disappear<br/>
My brother welcomed me to his land <br/>
And shared his hell<br/>
Near him I understood true humility<br/>
To touch serenity.</p></div>

This poem was written as an offering to all my ancestors, spiritual and genetic when I received the lamp transmission to become a Dharma teacher in 2011. Thay’s teachings have helped me to heal the suffering that I carried from seeing the suffering and experiencing the loss of many members of my family.

<div class="verse"><p>A hand that protects<br/>
A hand that caresses<br/>
A hand that loves<br/>
A hand that guides us<br/>
A hand that shows us the way<br/>
The hand of our ancestors<br/>
The hand of our teacher<br/>
A hand of love<br/>
A hand that supports<br/>
A hand that inspires<br/>
A hand of poetry<br/>
A hand that contains the whole cosmos<br/>
A hand filled with clouds, stars, cups of tea<br/>
A hand that has known despair, hate, discrimination, fear<br/>
A hand that prays<br/>
A hand that unites<br/>
A hand filled with faith<br/>
A hand that welcomes<br/>
A hand that embraces<br/>
A hand that shares<br/>
A hand that relieves<br/>
A hand passed down through the generations<br/>
Thank you Beloved Thay<br/>
Recognising your hand<br/>
Recognising that there is no separation<br/>
You are in me<br/>
I am in you<br/>
Your hand continues through millions of hands.</p></div>

I was always very moved when I watched Thay’s hands, the way that Thay held his cup of tea, opened a door, placed his hand on our heads and how Thay gave us teachings using the example of his hands. This poem was written in December 2016 for Thay.
