<div class="verse removeTopMarginInFollowingElem removeIndentInFollowingElem" style="column-span: all; margin-bottom: 1.1em;"><p>I am sitting by a pond full of lotus flowers. This year is already half over, yet the buds of the lotus flowers have still not bloomed. They take their time. The sun shines on the lush green and bowl shaped lotus leaves. Yesterday, I saw water collecting in these leaves, swirling around with the wind. I gaze at the forest behind the pond. The enormous trees reach almost to the light blue sky. Their leaves rustle, as if they are all waving to me excitedly. I smile back. Alongside the pond a bird hops through the meadow. Even though he can fly, it must be beautiful to wander on the Earth sometimes. I feel how Mother Earth holds me. Throughout my life and until the end of my life she will do so.</p>

<p>Since my arrival here (Plum Village), I have realized that I have found another paradise on this earth. Surrounded by nature and by mindful and loving people I feel safe and so alive.  This place in southwestern France reminds me of my two homelands (Germany and Vietnam). 
Here lotus flowers and bamboo trees grow along with a few banana trees amidst Western European flora. Here, nuns and monks in dark brown robes and shaven heads live. Most of them speak Vietnamese and I feel a slight heaviness because even though we share the same homeland, I hardly speak their language. I feel that it is easier for me to connect to the Western nun because all my life I have tried and learned to adapt to Western people, so that I can be a part of them. Those who are now unfamiliar to me are those who I share the same roots with.</p>

<p>I go inwards repeatedly. Bells ring regularly in this place. They remind us to pause and return to ourselves. Over time I learn that there is a home that needs no words, where language barriers do not become walls. That is the place within me. In Noble Silence we spend the time from dusk until morning. During this time I learned that the most important language is that of the heart.</p></div>

A very wise sister once said to me: “It’s like the leaves. One day they fall from the branches down to the Earth. They want to get back to their roots.” The sister could not have described better how I feel as a German-Vietnamese and how much I long to find my way back to my roots. The first time I went to Plum Village for the Asian Retreat, I felt like my search had come to an end. Between the silence and my breath, a space was created in which so much could unfold. Suddenly my ancestors, my homeland and my roots were very close to me. I was able to experience that everything I had longed for was not only to be found on the other side of the world, thousands of kilometers away. What I was looking for also existed inside of me. With the help of the practice, the Sangha and Thay’s teachings, I can be close to my roots in every moment.
