<div class="verse removeTopMarginInFollowingElem removeIndentInFollowingElem" style="column-span: all; margin-bottom: 1.1em;"><p>I am sitting by a pond full of lotus flowers. This year is already half over, yet the buds of the lotus flowers have still not bloomed. They take their time.<br/>
The sun shines on the lush green and bowl shaped lotus leaves. Yesterday, I saw water collecting in these leaves, swirling around with the wind.<br/>
I gaze at the forest behind the pond. The enormous trees reach almost to the light blue sky. Their leaves rustle, as if they are all waving to me excitedly.<br/>
I smile back. Alongside the pond a bird hops through the meadow. Even though he can fly, it must be beautiful to wander on the Earth sometimes.<br/>
I feel how Mother Earth holds me. Throughout my life and until the end of my life she will do so.</p>

<p>Since my arrival here (Plum Village), I have realized that I have found another paradise on this earth.<br/>
Surrounded by nature and by mindful and loving people I feel safe and so alive. <br/>
This place in southwestern France reminds me of my two homelands. (Germany and Vietnam)<br/>
Here lotus flowers and bamboo trees grow along with a few banana trees amidst Western European flora. <br/>
Here, nuns and monks in dark brown robes and shaven heads live. Most of them speak Vietnamese and I feel a slight heaviness because even though<br/>
we share the same homeland, I hardly speak their language.<br/>
I feel that it is easier for me to connect to the Western nun because all my life I have tried and learned to adapt to Western people, so that I can be a part of them.<br/>
Those who are now unfamiliar to me are those who I share the same roots with.</p>

<p>I go inwards repeatedly. Bells ring regularly in this place. They remind us to pause and return to ourselves. Over time I learn that there is a home that<br/>
needs no words, where language barriers do not become walls. That is the place within me.<br/>
In Nobel Silence we spend the time from dusk until morning. During this time I learned that the most important language is that of the heart.</p></div>

A very wise sister once said to me: “It’s like the leaves. One day they fall from the branches down to the Earth. They want to get back to their roots.” The sister could not have described better how I feel as a German-Vietnamese and how much I long to find my way back to my roots. The first time I went to Plum Village for the Asian Retreat, I felt like my search had come to an end. Between the silence and my breath, a space was created in which so much could unfold. Suddenly my ancestors, my homeland and my roots were very close to me. I was able to experience that everything I had longed for was not only to be found on the other side of the world, thousands of kilometers away. What I was looking for also existed inside of me. With the help of the practice, the Sangha and Thay’s teachings, I can be close to my roots in every moment.
